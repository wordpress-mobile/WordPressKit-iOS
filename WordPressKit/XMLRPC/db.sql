00:00:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your guest host Chloé Bringmann. And here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro music)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have the privilege of guest hosting this episode of the WordPress Briefing. And today I have with me a very special guest. The Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, Angela Jin. Welcome. Before we dive into all the questions, can you tell me and our listeners a little bit about your role in the WordPress community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:01:01]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, happy to, and thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;m very excited to be here. I am the Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, and I provide oversight and guidance for our WordPress programs, such as our events programs, training, and Five for the Future, with an eye toward ensuring their sustainability and growth. I&#8217;m very fortunate to work with our contributors across many teams around the world. In addition to troubleshooting and helping folks figure out how to move forward, I also spend a good amount of time exploring with others what could be in our programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:01:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We just got back from WordCamp Europe in Athens, Greece. It was such an energizing event for me, but I&#8217;m curious about what your impressions were of the past week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:01:52]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it was fantastic. I&#8217;m always really inspired by what a group of like-minded people can achieve together. There&#8217;s a lot of passion for this particular WordCamp, and it made for a really wonderful WordPress experience. Full of lots of great connections and memories; I have a million follow-ups and probably even more thoughts to reflect on. So it&#8217;s great. There were a lot of new WordPressers there. So it was lovely to meet them. And I&#8217;m really excited to see how many exciting new projects and ideas that we have in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:02:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same, you said it perfectly. Josepha also mentioned in the flagship’s keynote, the proposal for the next generation of WordCamps. I&#8217;m curious about what the main ideas and goals, as discussed thus far, are of that proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:02:42]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For sure. So WordCamps have been fundamental for the WordPress community for a very long time. And while they have continued to grow larger and reach more places around the world, it&#8217;s also undeniable that the way that people meet has changed since 2006.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:01]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, just as WordPress itself iterates we&#8217;re looking at iterating on WordCamps so that they move from fundamental to indispensable for the WordPressers of today and tomorrow. So event attendees today are looking to learn essential skills, make connections that lead to neat opportunities, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to that end, we put forth an updated purpose for our events, which is that WordPress events spark innovation and adoption by way of accessible training and networking for users, builders, designers, and extenders. We celebrate community by accelerating 21st-century skills, professional opportunities, and partnerships for WordPressers of today and tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:47]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the goal here is to create events that are more clearly defined &#8211; who these are for what you will gain from attending. We are looking to see events that take a deeper dive into content, or topics and provide more advanced content. And let&#8217;s try out some different formats and see how that shapes our event experience. And so it is a big shift. And change is always hard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:04:13]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the feedback that I&#8217;ve gotten so far, and certainly at WordCamp Europe, is that this is a very welcome evolution. And the Community team has already received over 60 proposals. So I&#8217;m very excited about that. In fact, a WordPress Community Day in Rome has already been announced and is focused on providing meet-up organizing and community management skills. So that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Chloé Bringmann 00:04:37]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow, that&#8217;s incredible. I love that we&#8217;ve gotten 60 suggestions already and that we already have an event in place. That&#8217;s fantastic. In that blog post, too, it&#8217;s mentioned that WordCamps should prioritize inclusivity and diversity. How can organizers ensure these values are upheld in the next generation of WordCamps and beyond events? Into our day-to-day project involvement?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:04]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent question. So while WordCamps themselves are changing, some of our core values, like prioritizing inclusivity and diversity, are non-negotiable. For the whole project, we have a diversity, equity, and inclusion statement, and a Code of Conduct that lays out how we expect our community to engage with each other in this space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on top of that, our programs do focus on providing resources and training like how to create a diverse speaker roster. And we have diverse speaker training workshops on how to organize a diverse and inclusive WordPress event. And we also have a great list of third-party resources as well. And so, with so many events, we create a lot of opportunities to grow as a visible contributor, whether it is a speaker, a volunteer, or an organizer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:56]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so with the next generation of events, we could more intentionally create these spaces for groups that historically have been underrepresented. Even long before my post went live, the BlackPress meetup group, for example, wanted to create an event that connected with historically black colleges and universities. And an event like that that really invites a specific group to learn all about WordPress would be a really great experience and a wonderful way to celebrate that community and a great connection to the broader community so that we can intentionally get to the diversity that we want to see.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:06:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also want to add that the people who are underrepresented in our community are more likely to need financial sponsorship. And so even though we do keep our ticket prices low so that our events are more easily accessible, the cost of travel continues to increase, not to mention the time and energy required to participate in these events. So an excellent way that companies can help is to sponsor somebody&#8217;s time and somebody&#8217;s contributions, which we&#8217;re always trying to encourage through the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:07:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beautiful. So, with that in mind, how do you foresee the next generation of WordCamps impacting the WordPress community, that larger ecosystem? So, what changes do you hope to see regarding community engagement, learning opportunities, and best practices?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:07:31]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I foresee us evolving our tried and true event format into a dynamic wealth of community-led opportunities. I know that online events were pretty exhausting during the worst of the pandemic, but there is a ton of unexplored opportunities there. And community research is also showing that online is a great way to create more inclusive and diverse events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:07:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Training team, with their learn WordPress online workshops, have really led the way with our online events. And there are so many more people that we can reach there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:08:08]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in addition to providing more advanced content, I also hope to see content around broader tech and business trends that influence WordPress, and conversely, how WordPress can shape those trends as well. And with all of that, I really hope that we can bring in more community members that otherwise wouldn&#8217;t be interested in what we currently offer, especially a younger generation that will help us drive the next generation of WordPress, the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:08:39]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very excited to hear all of this, and I bet our listeners are too. I&#8217;m curious how they and community members can provide feedback or get involved with this next generation of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:08:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to encourage everyone, please come chat with the Community team and comment on the current posts. We really welcome your feedback to help us get our events to this next iteration of what they will become. There are two posts, in particular, one is to suggest ideas of event formats and topics that you would like to see. And the second is if you are an organizer, we&#8217;re inviting you to hear some recommendations for improved tooling that would be helpful for your event site. And we&#8217;ll include links to those posts in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:09:26]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One final question for you, Angela. Any thoughts as we prepare for WordCamp US and the Community Summit, which will be in National Harbor, Maryland, in August?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:09:37]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Community Summit in particular, if you want to attend and you haven&#8217;t already applied, please please do make sure to apply as soon as possible. And encourage somebody else who you think should attend to apply as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:09:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if financial constraints are a blocker, we are aiming to help with the cost of hotel and or flight. And so one way to help support the diversity and inclusion of this event, and really to the whole project, is to also contribute to the Community Summit travel fund. You can find information about all of that on the Community Summit site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:10:15]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And next, if you have a topic in mind that you think needs to be discussed at the Community Summit, please please also share that information with us as well. And last but not least, I am, I am so excited. I&#8217;m not going to spoil anything. But I have been working with the WordCamp US organizing team and looking at some of what they have planned and some of the content. It&#8217;s going to be a truly incredible event, so don&#8217;t miss out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:010:41]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wonderful. Thank you so much for joining me, Angela. And I can&#8217;t wait to see you and the WordPress community in August in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:010:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to our small list of big things. First up is the proposal and establishment of a new WordPress contributor team, the Sustainability team. Coming into WordCamp Europe, a proposal was put forward to create a team that would embed sustainable practices and processes in the ecosystem to ensure the Project&#8217;s longevity, both socially, economically, and as well environmentally. At WordCamp Europe, this proposal was confirmed, and the Sustainability team is now officially the 22nd contributor team that WordPressers can support with their contributions. Head on over to their making WordPress Slack channel, #sustainability, and join the conversation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:011:39]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, I would like to call your attention to the 6.4 development cycle post that was published on June 5th. 6.4 will be the third major release of 2023 and supports our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts by being led by those contributors that identify as underrepresented gender. This release will also be the first to kick off phase three of the Gutenberg roadmap, which is collaborative editing and workflows. I&#8217;ve included a link to the post in our show notes and encourage anyone who is interested in being part of this momentous release to join us in making this both impactful and meaningful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:012:16]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, WordCamp US, as discussed, will be upon us before we know it starting on August 24th at National Harbor, Maryland. While tickets may be sold out, volunteers are still very much needed to make the flagship event run smoothly. So stop by us.wordcamp.org, raise your hand, and join us in August for engagement, inspiration, and learning. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. I&#8217;m your guest host Chloé Bringmann and thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"15179\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"Twenty Years of WordPress at WCEU\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/06/twenty-years-of-wordpress-at-wceu/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 10 Jun 2023 22:21:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"WordCamp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"WCEU\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15167\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:373:\"Inspiring the global community The atmosphere was electric at WordCamp Europe (WCEU) 2023 in Athens, Greece, as WordPress celebrated its 20th anniversary and the opportunity to gather in person for inspiration and engagement.

More than 2,500 individuals from 94 countries came together in person or through the live stream to participate in a remarkable three-day event (plus Contributor Day) filled with talks, networking, and learning opportunities. The event concluded on June 10 with a captivating keynote address by WordPress co-founder <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, Executive Director <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a>, and Gutenberg Product Architect <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matveb/\">Matías Ventura</a>, who highlighted the advancements and upcoming milestones of the WordPress Project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One significant update shared during the keynote was the successful reactivation of WordCamps. This time last year, we organized eight in-person WordCamps, and by the end of 2022, the number had risen to 23. Thanks to the enthusiasm and involvement of the WordPress community, we are already on track to organize 25 WordCamps in the first half of this year alone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha also emphasized the importance of the upcoming Community Summit on August 22-23. This in-person gathering brings contributors together across the WordPress open source project, fostering cross-project discussions vital for future growth and sustainability. For more information, visit the official <a href=\"https://communitysummit.wordcamp.org/2023/\">Community Summit website</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/Five-for-the-Future-WCEU-1.png?resize=585%2C365&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Total contributors: 7788 (737 new)\nContributors pledged to 5ftF: 780 (95 new)\n152 companies total with confirmed contributors (30 new)\" class=\"wp-image-15171\" width=\"585\" height=\"365\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/Five-for-the-Future-WCEU-1.png?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/Five-for-the-Future-WCEU-1.png?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/Five-for-the-Future-WCEU-1.png?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/Five-for-the-Future-WCEU-1.png?resize=1536%2C960&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/Five-for-the-Future-WCEU-1.png?resize=2048%2C1280&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussing the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future</a> (5ftF) program, Josepha highlighted the impressive growth in active contributors and company pledges over the past year. She also underscored the expansion of the WordPress ecosystem, citing examples like <a href=\"https://openverse.org/\">Openverse</a>, which now provides access to nearly 800 million images and audio files, all easily accessible in the Site Editor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another exciting addition to the WordPress repertoire is <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/\">WP Playground</a>. This new feature allows users to build WordPress applications instantly in the browser without needing a PHP server. This tool provides a swift and seamless experience, reducing the installation time from five minutes to a near-instantaneous 500 milliseconds. The application of WP Playground may seem like magic, but its practical application promises tangible and revolutionary benefits for WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías Ventura then took the stage to share updates on Gutenberg. Through a visually stunning video built entirely with blocks, he showcased the six-year development journey and the transition from words to blocks to a final design.

Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro music)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of this year, there has been a lot of research and examination of the contributor funnel in the WordPress community. That research confirms some assumptions about what most contributor stories have in common: the hurdles, the general paths taken, and the way that problem-solving was done. Then in February of this year, Hari Shanker published a proposal for a mentorship program for WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we&#8217;ve got a pilot program that&#8217;s been defined and is waiting for your feedback. If you&#8217;ve not read the post about the contributor mentorship program, for one do it. But if you would rather hear a synopsis from me, don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m about to give you a 10-cent tour.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:22]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, who is doing this? This pilot program has been outlined by a community working group. We often have working groups in WordPress, and they almost always have specific projects around events or programs, or code updates. Since this working group is focused on a project-wide program, there is project-wide representation in it. All the names are at the bottom of the post, which you can find in our show notes. But it&#8217;s got folks who contribute with code or contribute with time or contribute with design folks who are self-sponsored or corporately sponsored, just a nice mix of people. The program as a whole, though, is being stewarded by Hari Shankar, a longtime supporter of and contributor to WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:06]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So next, what is this for? There are a few goals for the program. But the overarching goal is to increase the success of new contributors over time. We can all agree that if we were to have 1000s of new contributors every day, but they couldn&#8217;t find their way to impactful contributions or meaningful connections quickly, then we would have done them a disservice. And they probably won&#8217;t continue to be part of the community without a bit more effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The when and the where are essentially “right now and right here,” so that brings us finally to Why. Why are we doing this mentorship program? Apart from to help people who want to contribute have an easier path to success – which frankly is enough of a reason anyway – the why is wrapped up in our overall philosophies in the project. If we believe that good ideas can come from anywhere and that contributions of any size matter. And that open source is an idea that can change our generation and that we are democratizing publishing, then bringing new people brings new ideas, and beginner contributions can grow over time. We can maintain this idea, this concept of open source, into the next generation and to future generations. And always keep our sights on the open web. To learn more about this and other project-wide initiatives, swing by make.wordpress.org/project or check the links in today&#8217;s show notes on wordpress.org/news/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:53]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:56]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First on the list is WordCamp Europe. That&#8217;s coming up at the end of the week on June 8 through 10th in Athens, Greece. There will be a major update from Matt and friends, so even if you aren&#8217;t there in person, keep an eye out for those recordings. But for those who are there and you&#8217;re curious about the mentorship program or anything else to do with WordPress and contributing to the project, you can come find me or Angela Jin, Hari will also be there, Chloé will be there, Héctor will be there, lots of people, and we want to hear your thoughts and answer your questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is a call for brainpower! A call for your brainstorms! On the subject of the next generation, we&#8217;ve got a discussion going on about the next generation of WordCamps. We&#8217;ve been discussing what new types and varieties might be available, and that might make sense for people as we get back to in-person events. So if you&#8217;ve got a kind of WordCamp that you&#8217;ve been desperately wanting to try, now&#8217;s the time to let folks know about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:54]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is the second volume of The WordPress history book called Building Blocks: The Evolution of WordPress is now available for download in several formats as well as on GitHub. Stop buy, give it a read, and relive some of the highlights of the past ten years of the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:12]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your smallest of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

His initial learning in the 1990s was through joining friends at a local pub where they could explore how websites were structured and learn to use chat software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This led to Stefano creating websites for fun in 1998, and his first paid job was for the shop where he bought comics. He turned to content management systems (CMS) to speed up the creation process for sites, but found he needed more documentation to really understand their capabilities. Then he read a magazine article about WordPress, a CMS which was being used to make incredible blog sites, and was supported by an international community and documentation. Over time, Stefano started using that documentation to work on websites in Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress provides a life-changing turning point&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stefano describes himself as an introvert. He found that WordPress helped him to work from home, to develop his skills and the quality of what he could produce, as well as build his self-confidence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A catalyst for the turning point in his life and career was the discovery of an area for events on the WordPress dashboard. On this page, he found a forthcoming local meetup in Rome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2017, Stefano took the step to go along to this event, led by a curiosity of what he might discover and intrigued by how a software could be supported by a vast community. The topic at the event was on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/\">WP-CLI</a>, a command line interface for WordPress. He recalled that he felt outside his comfort zone as he did not regard himself as a developer and at that point, had only used the software for simple jobs. He wondered whether using the software as his only CMS was going to be a long term option and if these meetups were suitable for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the meetup, people were talking about a forthcoming event, called WordCamp Rome. Through his research, he saw that there was a lot of enthusiasm for this event. This intrigued him and he wondered if it would show him that he could have a career using the software after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfamiliar with WordCamps, Stefano found it difficult at first to know what he could go to and how to get involved, but he persevered and attended the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;The WordCamp was a great discovery: talks at all levels from basic to those for developers, advanced and very advanced. I was immediately struck by the enthusiasm of the volunteers.

It was new to Stefano, but with help from those attending, he signed up for the messaging tool Slack, used by the WordPress community.

In this team, people from across the world<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\"> translate the WordPress software into many different languages</a>. He started with translating a theme he was using in his work. Little by little he became more interested in plugins and attended meetings with other translators. He offered his skills to translate into Italian themes and plugins in general and as his experience grew, he took on the volunteer role of a General Translation Editor. He also took care of the translation into Italian of the WordPress Core. More recently he has joined the group of translators for the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/helphub/\">HelpHub</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/\">WordPress documentation</a> system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “Participating in the WordPress Slack has helped me enormously: I’ve met a lot of people who I now call friends. Moreover, by translating, I learned a lot about how themes and plugins work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It&#8217;s a great way to contribute to WordPress, especially for someone like me who is not a developer. Translating also allows me to fully understand how WordPress works.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I always say that translating themes, plugins, and the Core software is the best way to learn WordPress, better than any course or book.”</p>\n<cite>Stefano Cassone</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sharing skills to support Open Source WordPress</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"667\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-WC-2019.jpg?resize=667%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Stefano volunteering as a photographer at a WordCamp in 2019 with other contributors.\" class=\"wp-image-15026\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-WC-2019.jpg?w=667&amp;ssl=1 667w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-WC-2019.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Stefano volunteering as a photographer at a WordCamp in 2019 with other contributors.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stefano’s growing commitment to the open source WordPress project was further boosted through his volunteering. He was a volunteer at WordCamp Rome 2018 and participated there in his first Contributor Day where he had the opportunity to translate the software with others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was also able to bring his own hobbies and skills to help the project grow and reach others. One example was his passion for photography, and he volunteered as a photographer for many other events in Italy organized by the WordPress community. He said: “This commitment to the community also allows me to have fun: being a photographer means having the opportunity to walk around the halls and capture moments of the life of a WordCamp.” The more WordCamps he attended, the more he wanted to be part of and keep contributing to the wider WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contribution to WordPress is inspiring</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Stefano at the Support Table at a WordPress Contributor Day\" class=\"wp-image-15025\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Stefano at the Support Table at a WordPress Contributor Day</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When Stefano was asked to become an organizer for the WordPress meetup in Rome in October 2019, he knew he wanted to be part of reaching and supporting more people in his area. He faced challenges with finding venues, but a greater issue was to come: the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spurred on by the <a href=\"https://it.wordpress.org/\">Italian WordPress community</a> as a whole, he was determined that the meetup was still needed. The regular event was transformed into an online meeting. He was able to gain help from people he had met as a volunteer to share their expertise with meetup attendees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community in Italy also worked together to put on WordCamp Italia online. It brought together the organizers of previous meetups and WordCamps, and new contributors too. Stefano volunteered in both online editions of this camp, including being part of the social and communication team. He found it to not only be a fun experience but also one that helped him grow professionally and learn from so many others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He went onto help restart the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/romawordpress/\">Rome WordPress meetup</a> in-person meetings in May 2022, was an organizer for the third WordCamp Italy, and has been volunteering for camps in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What will WordPress bring you?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-a-wc.jpg?resize=533%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Stefano inspired by his journey at WordCamps asks what will WordPress bring you?\" class=\"wp-image-15024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-a-wc.jpg?w=533&amp;ssl=1 533w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-a-wc.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Stefano inspired by his journey at WordCamps asks what will WordPress bring you?</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Persona and professional growth and friendship” are some of the things they have brought Stefano. Contributing boosted his confidence and willingness to try new opportunities in his work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “The best thing I got out of joining the WordPress community was the chance to collaborate with some people on a working basis and, I have to say, that was incredible. Being with many of them you have an incredible opportunity to grow in knowledge, you just have to be ready to learn. With WordPress you never stop learning.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His top recommendation is: “Join your local meetup or think about organizing one, it will introduce you to an amazing world. Don’t be afraid to meet people at WordCamps and Contributor Days, because you will learn more there than in dozens of courses. Talk to people at those events and don’t worry. The WordPress community is inclusive so you’ll always feel welcome, and you will see enthusiasm like you’ve never seen at other IT events. Sign-up and get involved.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community.&nbsp;Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Stefano Cassone (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/deadpool76/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>deadpool76</a>)&nbsp;for sharing about his adventures in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), the late Surendra Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>sthakor</a>) and Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>) for interviews, writing the feature and collaborating on images, to Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), Mark Smallman (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marks99/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marks99</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), and Maja Loncar (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/majaloncar/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>majaloncar</a>) for help with reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>People of WordPress</em>&nbsp;series thanks Josepha Haden (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>chanthaboune</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>topher1kenobe</a>) for their support.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\" style=\"grid-template-columns:29% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro continues)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we&#8217;re gonna spend a little time talking about WP Playground. This is a project that debuted at State of the Word in December 2022, but it was demoed for me about a month prior in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was, and remain, absolutely floored by the potential future applications, as well as the innovative thinking behind it. So I&#8217;ve invited a couple of excellent WordPress futurists to the show today so that we can listen in on their conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome guys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:01:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey everyone, I&#8217;m Rich Tabor, and I&#8217;m here today with Adam Zielinski to talk about WordPress Playground. So for those of you who don&#8217;t know what WordPress Playground is, can you tell us a little bit more about it, Adam?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:01:18]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. WordPress Playground is WordPress that works in your browser like there&#8217;s no server with PHP or database like there&#8217;s just your browser and JavaScript, and you can run it in so many more places that we’ll all get to. For example, I just came back from WordCamp Gliwice, where on a Contributor Day, a couple of developers got set up with WordPress in just a couple of minutes, whereas normally, it can take hours to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:01:44]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s pretty impressive. Do you think that, particularly for WordCamps and other demo-type areas, this would be something that&#8217;s very useful? Or what do you think would be the other problems that could be solved with WordPress Playground?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:01:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playground solves one primary problem, and that is WordPress is pretty difficult to get started with. I&#8217;m not even talking about creating your website, but let&#8217;s say, someone told you there&#8217;s this WordPress thing that you should try. Well, you Google for it, and you find installation instructions, and there&#8217;s like three hours of work for you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then maybe you&#8217;ll find a hosting company, and you have to pay some money. So with WordPress Playground, you can actually try it for free because there&#8217;s no cost to run it. It just runs on your device. If you&#8217;re a developer, and you want to start learning WordPress, normally you have to go through quite an extensive setup process, and there are some tools to make it easier, but maybe there&#8217;s still friction like you have to even own a computer, like a PC device or a Mac. Playground can run on your phone, and it can power interactive tutorials that you can use and just start learning there and there with zero setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you work on a product team and someone asks you to test a code change, with Playground you can just click a link and test it with no infrastructure behind it. And if you&#8217;re a company creating a plugin, you can just show your plugin in a live demo to people. And this isn&#8217;t something many plugins are doing because it&#8217;s quite hard to get a live demo set up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:03:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, that&#8217;s pretty impressive. So, you know, amongst like tutorials, code changes for developer environments, the mobile application running, do you think that, since there&#8217;s such a wide brevity of ideas that WordPress Playground can kind of plug into, would this be more of a developer tool?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that right? Or is Playground more of a like a click and play-type application that can run anywhere and demo anything?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:03:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s both, but it&#8217;s more transparent for the users. So there are a whole lot of things you can do with Playground as a developer, as I just mentioned. But who are you doing these things for? Well, some of them are for the users, as in live demos, or there&#8217;s a WordCamp Europe coming, and I know some people are doing workshops there. They are going to use Playground to get everyone set up. So now that&#8217;s, well, maybe a workshop that teaches you how to build a theme, for example, right? Now you can just get started without any setup process. So there&#8217;s both, it&#8217;s very useful for development teams, and it&#8217;s very useful for them to build stuff for the final users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:04:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s great. I know you, and I have probably both been in the same scenario at WordCamps when you&#8217;re trying to get dev environments set up, and it takes, you know, the better half of the workshop to get to step one. So this is really gonna be interesting to see it, especially at WordCamp Europe, and to see it getting into action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you planning on going to WordCamp Europe this year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:04:39]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely, I will have a table at Contributor Day, a WordPress Playground table. So yeah, everyone&#8217;s invited to come over. I&#8217;ll show you a lot of cool stuff. And then at WP Connect on Saturday at 10:00 AM, there will be a WordPress Playground session where you&#8217;ll be able to learn more and see some cool demos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this will be a conversational format, so we&#8217;ll just have a nice chat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:05:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super cool. So how else can people find out a little bit more info about Playground and perhaps even get involved and contribute to the project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:05:08]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a developer.WordPress.org/playground website. There&#8217;s a link in a show notes where you&#8217;ll be able, like this is the perfect entry point to the entire rabbit hole of WordPress Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a quite a few projects under the WordPress Playground umbrella, and they all live in a single GitHub repository where you can just find any issue that interests if you want to contribute and just start contributing. Also, there&#8217;s a Slack channel in WordPress org space called #meta-playground, and I highly encourage everyone interested in coming over to say hi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And probably one of the best places to ask questions and get acquainted with the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:05:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, that&#8217;s great; I&#8217;m very intrigued about the project overall. I think that there&#8217;s an immense amount of potential, for WordPress Playground. Just last question here, like, where do you see the future of this project going? What is the most interesting application that hasn&#8217;t been done yet, or the things that are really gonna be the next level in unlocking Playground for everyone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:06:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s quite a few. Imagine being able to go to WordPress.org and have a WordPress demo right then and there without having to download anything. Then you customize it, and you have a button to host your website anywhere or just to download it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine having a live preview for all the themes and plugins in the directory and even in WordPress core, but these are sooner than later. Maybe like, let&#8217;s talk more grandiose, shall we? So there&#8217;s this term, 1 billion new users coming online in the next, like in the nearest future, and plenty of them doesn&#8217;t even own a desktop device. Maybe they have a mobile phone, maybe they have a tablet, maybe we&#8217;re talking about a young, prospective developer somewhere. And currently, if you don&#8217;t own a desktop device, you cannot contribute to the WordPress plugin ecosystem at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, we&#8217;re seeing more and more of creating themes with no code, which is really exciting. But you cannot build the plugin, really. Well, with WordPress Playground. Suddenly you can do development on a mobile device. So development tools and code editors and just the entire suite of things we use as the developers on our desktop of devices like this may come online and be available in your browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re on a train and you just have a phone with you, but you still want to learn, how to build a plugin, well, you&#8217;ll be able to do that. Furthermore, there&#8217;s a lot of exciting opportunities with ChatGPT, as in, well, here&#8217;s a WordPress running entirely on your device. So maybe if that&#8217;s connected to ChatGPT, you&#8217;ll be able to say, well, I like fish, or like, I want two columns and a photo of a racing car on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because ChatGPT can output HTML, we connect the two, and suddenly, you can build a website entirely in your browser using natural language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:08:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Man, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s really interesting. It really does unlock the next, potentially the next like, wave of innovation in the WordPress experience, especially removing all the complications of getting set up and actually seeing what&#8217;s there. I think that it really could, be huge for users every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:08:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, here&#8217;s one more. So, edge computing is big lately, and it&#8217;s going to be bigger in the future. WordPress Playground runs on this new technology called Web Assembly, and it just happened so that a bunch of edge computing providers allows you to run web assembly on their gear. So imagine having WordPress running entirely in edge infrastructure with no centralized server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truly decentralized WordPress. It could be big for a well cost of operating, but also for speed, but also even further down in the future. Imagine downloading the actual, you know, even WordPress around time to your device and having the entire website on your phone. So then you know, you&#8217;re on a train, you enter a tunnel, but you can still browse that WooCommerce store and add things to your cart even though there is no range at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:09:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s pretty crazy. How far out there do you think something like that is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:09:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell. I mean, technically, it is possible. There are a lot of challenges with regard to privacy, right? And data security for the edge computing case specifically. As for the development tools, there was a Cloud Fest hackathon earlier this year where I was with Daniel Bachhuber, also from Automattic, and we led this exciting project that brought the WordPress development environment into the browser using a couple of editors that are out there, and this is too much of an MVP for actual production use yet, but we got it working, and we build an actual plugin on a phone without internet access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:10:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow. And that was just a hackathon, just hacking at it to see what you can get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:10:23]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it was two and a half days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:10:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, that&#8217;s awesome. That&#8217;s really cool, man. Well, this has been quite a pleasure. Thanks, Adam, for chatting all about WordPress Playground. Folks, just be sure to check out developer.WordPress.org/playground to explore, experiment, and play with WordPress Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been awesome, Adam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:10:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for having me, Rich.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What a remarkable new way of working with and experiencing WordPress. I would love to be able to find ways across the project and ecosystem to help folks see what they&#8217;re getting into before they get into it, but also, who knows what the future holds for that project. Keep an eye on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Musical interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to our small list of big things happening right now in the WordPress project. The first one is that the Kim Parel Memorial Scholarship for WordCamp US 2023 is open, and applications for it are the WordPress Foundation will once again be offering that scholarship for Travel to WordCamp US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is for specifically for women in technology, women in the WordPress space. I&#8217;ll include a link to that in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is WordPress&#8217; 20th anniversary is still coming, as we heard in the last podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have reached over 100 events that are scheduled on or around May 27th, which is WordPress’ launch date. There is still time to find your closest location and attend one of those events. And probably, there&#8217;s also time to pull together an event of your own. Head on over to wp20.WordPress.net if you would like to see events in your area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is WordCamp US 2023. I realize WordCamp Europe comes before that, but the programming team actually has a really interesting thing that they&#8217;re doing this year. They have some changes to the way that they are organizing the event and finding speakers for the event. But as always, they are working very hard to make sure it is an attendee-focused event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna include a link or two to some announcements that are really worthwhile there.

Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you hadn&#8217;t heard yet. WordPress is celebrating its 20th anniversary on May 27th.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of celebrations and parties happening all across the world, hopefully with cake, because we all know that a party without cake is just a meeting and no one wants a year-long meeting about how old you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:59]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you&#8217;ve not yet joined the celebrations, there&#8217;s still time to share your favorite WordPress merch, your favorite WordCamp memory, host a whole dang party if you want to, or share a video to post on wp20.wordpress.net. I&#8217;ve got links to everything you need in the show notes. So if you haven&#8217;t done it yet, you can do that while you listen to today&#8217;s episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:14]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got links to everything you need in the show notes. So if you haven&#8217;t done it yet, you can do that while you listen to today&#8217;s episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:22]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, WordPress is the leading CMS in the market. And according to W3Tech&#8217;s it powers 43% of the web. And that&#8217;s like 35% of the top 10,000 sites that are built using this software. And sometimes, that&#8217;s as a website, sometimes as a framework, but always as a way for people and businesses to find a space on the web to call their own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:45]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021. The first-ever study on the WordPress ecosystem gave us an idea of just how large our ecosystem is. We already kind of had a sense that millions of people make a living through WordPress because we know that we are supporting small business owners and freelancers all the way out to agencies and content creators.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:06]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But according to that study, WordPress at the time was powering 82 million websites and enabled an estimated economy of $597 billion. The success of an economy like this and various other alternative economies hinges on the success of invisible open source software that powers the web, just like WordPress, that has a tonne of growth and a lot of wins since that first Cafe Log fork way back in 2003.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:37]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And WordPress could just say pencils down, everybody. Good job, team, and just kind of watch what comes next. But I&#8217;ve never met a word processor, emboldened as we are by our belief in open source freedoms, who stepped away from a challenge worth facing the recognition that everyone should have those freedoms whether they know they exist or not. Because I know that no one cares as much about open source freedoms as open source maintainers. But the recognition that everyone has the right to them anyway is built into the foundations of what WordPress is and who WordPress is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:13]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are big plans for WordPress future, many of which are grounded in the promise of a new block editor within WordPress that aims to lower the barriers to entry for people at any point in their learning curve. So let&#8217;s take a look at what this means for WordPress, the software, and follow up about what it means for the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:31]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, the software right at the end of 2018, the Gutenberg editor was merged into WordPress Core. And it&#8217;s subverted the way that people had always managed their content. It brought with it this new concept of site building that focused on blocks as the primary mode of creation. It was modular and required very little code knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably also very little skill with design. Although if you&#8217;ve ever seen me tried to design something with blocks, you will know it takes some skill. But still, the ultimate goal was to make those fundamental user interactions of managing the block and apply them in any place you could manage your site using WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you think about the possibility to create media-rich content without having to work with shortcode, without having to know HTML workarounds, it opens the opportunity for many of us in the WordPress community to own our digital presence. In case it wasn&#8217;t already clear, this, my friends, is an audacious project, and it&#8217;s even more so if you remember that we have this existing and massive ecosystem that is enabled and empowered by our software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:42]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as we look forward to the third phase of the Gutenberg Project, collaborative editing inside a WordPress installation will soon be a reality, which if you are like me and you never work on a website alone, you&#8217;re probably just dying to have. I say all this not to toot the horn have WordPress or belabor our success but rather to emphasize the importance of what I&#8217;m going to say next, which is how this CMS got to where it is, namely through the work of the community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:12]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has survived, and I would dare to say thrived through decades of constant economic, cultural, and technological shifts. And I believe that the thing that keeps us innovating fast enough to stay relevant but slow enough to be ethical, is how the community actively engages with the open source project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that our strength is directly tied to the resilience of our contributors. And we know that the software we ship is shaped by the people who are willing to tell us what they love, what they hate, and what they hope to see. When the WordPress project started, we mainly had code contributions as a way to give back, but over time, the project has grown to include contributions to learning, community building, and translations, among other things, but all of that exists alongside the CMS-focused contributions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:03]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because WordPress as an organization understands that it is an integral part of an ecosystem of 1000s of global companies and millions of individual people who are building careers, starting businesses, learning new skills, and becoming part of something meaningful. I know that I talk just all the time about the greatness of WordPress as a software and community, which makes sense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:29]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really do love the work I do with you all. But I am equally in awe of this open-hearted journey of disruption that WordPress represents as an open source project. WordPress and its community is part of a long line of disruptors; blogs made publishing available to everyone, which maybe doesn&#8217;t sound like a big deal right now because you&#8217;ve been around blogging forever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:51]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve been able to just put your thoughts on the internet with almost no effort for as long as you have known the internet existed, but WordPress, at the time, was and honestly remains the low code open source CMS of choice. It has been for years. And so, let me backtrack you through the 10,000-foot milestones of our journey here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:14]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg has been around since 2013. It&#8217;s 10 years. I know, don&#8217;t get scared, we&#8217;re celebrating 20 years. So it&#8217;s been around for half of our time as a concept. Open source as a concept was formalized in the 1980s. Though it definitely has been around longer than that as a concept and a way of working.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this low-code, no-code movement that we hear about from time to time that has been around since the 1970s, and just because we first became aware of it in the 1970s doesn&#8217;t mean that that&#8217;s when it actually first was discussed or thought about or used. Which means that you are in this moment, decades deep into projects that changed our entire understanding of the web.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:59]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So grab a slice of cake, and raise a glass to 20 great years of WordPress, and I am going to raise a glass to 20 more years of continuing our journey together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:17]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us effervescently to the small list of big things. Yeah, I said effervescently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:24]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are a lot of things happening in the WordPress project over the next couple of weeks. There is a lot of testing going on. There are a lot of releases that are getting underway. There are events and things. So here&#8217;s my rundown of stuff you should take a look at.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So firstly, there is a post out about performance improvements from 6.2. That is just inviting an open discussion so that we can get more of those improvements in better shape to get into the 6.3 release. And speaking of the 6.3 release that is coming, just last week, we announced the release squad that we have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an extra heavy release squad because we also are working toward the 6.4 release just at the same time. So there&#8217;s the folks who are running the 6.3 release, and they have committed to working openly and in public channels as much as possible so that the 6.4 folks have a chance to really take a look at what goes into a release, the questions that we ask, the philosophies we believe in, and then that 6.4 release oil pick up probably, my guess is August-ish, mid-August or so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That 6.4 release is specifically going to be made up entirely of diverse genders. People that we historically see are underrepresented in technology, but as always, we accept contributions from everyone for all releases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:48]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing is that we have WordCamp Europe coming up, that is June 8 and 10th. So a little bit past the two-week mark.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:54]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is a final call for volunteers for anyone who wants to be able to help at the event. I personally have always enjoyed doing that kind of volunteer work. It helps you get to know your community even a bit better. And I don&#8217;t know; I&#8217;m just kind of an extroverted people person. So, of course, I always want to volunteer, but that call is still open. And they&#8217;re in the last phases of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:17]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a team or two that needs some help with getting leads for the contributor day that happens leading up to WordCamp. Europe, I know that the testing team needs a lead for the table, and so if you enjoy the process of triaging or testing or helping people get their environment set up, that is a great opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:37]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing on my small, my big small list of big things is that we have a kind of a review of the currently defined contributor ladder for the Polyglots team. There are a number of posts over the years where we talk about the ways that people move through being a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:57]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that we know about almost all contributor ladders is that there&#8217;s no time requirement between the steps, but in general, it functions like a ladder. So you do have to have, like, rung one. And then, rung two, if you try to skip from rung one to rung three, you will have a lot of difficulty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:17]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not impossible, but it&#8217;s harder than going 1, 2, 3 In the normal sequential order. And so that&#8217;s a whole discussion that&#8217;s happening over there.

This new feature, designed to be an extensible quick search and command execution tool, was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-15-6-introduces-experimental-details-block-and-command-center-for-site-editor\">introduced in Gutenberg 15.6</a>. In <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-16-0-introduces-page-management-in-the-site-editor\">version 16.0</a>, it came out of the experimental stage and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51169\">its API is now public</a>, ready for developers to create their own custom commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/48457#issuecomment-1487439383\">Command Center mockups</a> &#8211; Gutenberg repository\n\n\n\n<p>The Command Center is on track to land in the upcoming WordPress 6.3 release but may be arriving under a different name. Automattic-sponsored contributor Reyes Martínez opened the discussion and identified three main purposes the feature is meant to serve: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Quickly search, navigate, and switch between different types of content</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run commands to perform tasks or actions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Extend and customize the tool, also with AI, via third parties (plugins)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The concept of a command center can convey the idea of a centralized location to execute commands and manage tasks, but it seems a bit technical and carries some militant connotations,&#8221; Martínez said. &#8220;Additionally, after reading some <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/17/command-center-request-for-feedback/\">feedback left in Riad’s call for feedback</a>, my impression (from a marketing perspective) is that this name may not fully convey its potential and different use cases.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martínez contends that &#8220;Wayfinder&#8221; as a name &#8220;better captures its different use cases&#8221; and &#8220;reflects benefits, and appeals to a less technical audience.&#8221; She also suggested that it &#8220;has the potential to evoke a sense of curiosity, exploration, and discovery in more types of users.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two Automattic-sponsored contributors responded with support for Wayfinder as the name shortly after the discussion was posted. Nearly every other participant has highlighted concerns about using Wayfinder and suggested other names that more clearly describe the feature. The term does not have a direct translation in many languages and leans heavily towards navigation, leaving out the other purposes the feature is meant to serve, such as running commands and actions, as well as AI and other third-party integrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\'m not sure I could articulate why I feel so strong about the naming of the command bar coming to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> Site Editor (and eventually the whole Dashboard <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f91e-1f3fd.png\" alt=\"🤞🏽\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />) in a tweet, but wow I have strong feelings. <a href=\"https://t.co/yP4dx1LEDl\">https://t.co/yP4dx1LEDl</a></p>&mdash; Aurooba Ahmed (@aurooba) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aurooba/status/1670800659837321217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 19, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s two things here. One is &#8216;What is it?&#8217; and the other is &#8216;What is it called?\'&#8221;  WP Engine developer Ross Wintle said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I would rather it was just called a command palette on both counts. This is by far the most common term in use to describe this kind of thing. I see no need to stray from popular convention. Anything else is either confusing or marketing and I don&#8217;t like either.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He suggests WordPress adopt the term based on its well-documented use throughout the industry for similar features in apps like Sublime Text, VS Code, GitHub, Jira, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We did hear Matías call it <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7Nmz3IjtPh0?t=911\">a &#8220;Wayfinder tool&#8221; in the WordCamp Europe 2023 Keynote</a>, so at this point perhaps making arguments for it to be called something else <em>may</em> be moot, I&#8217;m not sure,&#8221; WordPress developer Aurooba Ahmed said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However, I was curious about the argument that a term using the word <code>command</code> would be less appealing to non-developers, so I wanted to document names around the internet for command palettes that I&#8217;ve seen in non-developer tools/services (to augment <a href=\"https://github.com/rosswintle\">@rosswintle</a>&#8216;s documenting of tools and what they call this feature as well). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahmed cited apps using &#8220;Command Palette,&#8221; including Miro, Reflect, and Obsidian. Another common name for this feature is &#8220;Command Menu,&#8221; used by Todoist and Cron. She also cited ClickUp as using &#8220;Command Center&#8221; and Missive using &#8220;Command Bar,&#8221; among other apps with similar terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s more, these are just the ones I could think of, off the top of my head,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I consider the argument that a name with the term <code>Command</code> would be less appealing to non-developers a very strong one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not to say that WordPress shouldn&#8217;t choose a different or unique name for this feature. However, then at this point I&#8217;m wondering what <em>kind</em> of name is wanted: one that feels new and different or one that clearly communicates its purpose and easy to remember?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Those ideas don&#8217;t have to be mutually exclusive, but going <em>against</em> a fairly internet-wide informally established naming convention and understanding of a certain feature should have a solid reason behind it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored contributor Nicholas Garofalo noted that the name itself will not be prominently featured in the interface, based on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/48457#issuecomment-1487439383\">recent mockups</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The name, like Gutenberg, will be used primarily for marketing and documentation,&#8221; Garofolo said. &#8220;That influences naming and translation concerns.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Even differences in US vs UK English make it extremely difficult to find a catchy (Ie. marketable) and universally understood (Ie. easily documented) name. That&#8217;s why I agree with the aforementioned recommendation that we treat this a bit like &#8216;Gutenberg&#8217; or &#8216;plugin.&#8217; If this were appearing frequently within the interface then I would perhaps feel different.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other suggestions from speakers of different languages include Actions hub, Finder, Quick commands, Quick actions, and Quick finder. Even if Gutenberg contributors are determined to emphasize the navigation aspect of the feature at the expense of its other capabilities, a term like Quick finder is more easily understood for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">52% of WordPress users</a> who use the software in a language other than English.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The term &#8216;Wayfinder&#8217; is very much associated with navigation and not with taking actions or giving commands,&#8221; WordPress developer Ian Svoboda said. &#8220;This feature’s purpose is to make it easier to run commands and move about the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A term like Wayfinder feels like marketing speak more than an actual feature name. Consider the difference between saying: &#8216;use the Wayfinder&#8217; and &#8216;use the command palette.&#8217; In the later example, the meaning and purpose is immediately clear. So sure someone else may not know what a &#8216;command palette&#8217; is but I’d wager way more folks know what a command palette is than a random feature in me specific app called Wayfinder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I would ask that we focus on being easy to understand and to translate above trying to be clever with a name.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/50925\">renaming the Command Center</a> is still open on the Gutenberg repository and discussion is ongoing. The general consensus of participants is to use clear language over a term that evokes curiosity (and likely confusion since it doesn&#8217;t translate well). A decision has not yet been made but should be forthcoming as WordPress 6.3 Beta 1 is expected on June 27, ahead of the general release on August 8.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Jun 2023 19:18:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"Do The Woo Community: Random Q&amp;A with Attendees at WordCamp Europe 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=75316\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://dothewoo.io/snippets-from-wordcamp-europe-2023/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:405:\"<p>Had a chance to ask some random questions with a few attendees at WordCamp Europe 2023 and ask them some fun questions.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/snippets-from-wordcamp-europe-2023/\">Random Q&#038;A with Attendees at WordCamp Europe 2023</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Jun 2023 08:40:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"WPTavern: WordPress Confirms 8 Pilot Events to Launch the Next Generation of WordCamps in 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=146019\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-confirms-8-pilot-events-to-launch-the-next-generation-of-wordcamps-in-2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3461:\"<p>In May 2023, WordPress&#8217; Community Team announced that it would be <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-evolves-wordcamp-format-to-promote-adoption-training-and-networking-for-professionals\">evolving the WordCamp format</a> to promote adoption, training, and networking for professionals, leaving the flagship events to focus more on connection and inspiration. This major shift opens the door for more experimentation through varied formats. In a recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2023/06/19/next-generation-of-wordpress-events-updates/\">update</a>, the team shared that progress on the discussions has generated 64 ideas with 59 organizers who are willing to follow up on their ideas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also eight pilot events that have been confirmed and six of them will launch in 2023. These include some of the most creative concepts that WordPress has ever officially entertained, as the previous WordCamp format had become predictable and requirements somewhat inflexible. These pilot events offer a glimpse of what events could look like going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community in Leipzig, Germany, is planning the first ever Low-Cost WordCamp for July 1, 2023. Organizers will host 90 attendees and keep costs low with no swag, no social dinner, and no after party. They will offer just one track of presentations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The goal is to motivate and help new and veteran organizers to create a lighter, impactful event that is low cost and requires less time, financial resources, and fewer organizers/volunteers,&#8221;  Automattic-sponsored Community Team contributor Isotta Peira said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors in Sevilla, Spain, are planning a &#8220;WordPress Day&#8221; on July 2, 2023, where the focus will be engaging 50 attendees in three different areas of contribution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The goal is to bring new contributors to the community and retain them by organizing multiple events every year,&#8221; Peira said. With these small numbers and limited goals, this effort could easily be organized as frequently as they anticipate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community in Tegal, Indonesia is planning a &#8220;Scale Up&#8221; Workshop for October 22, 2023. A group of 50 participants will join in a 1-day training event that will expand their WordPress skills by &#8220;diving into the world of WordPress for enterprise.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three other approved pilot events for 2023 include a Rural event for small towns/villages, a WP for Publishers in Bangalore, and a Community Day in Rome, Italy, designed for WordPress community organizers, scheduled for September 29.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the confirmed events fall within the new purpose for WordPress events that the Community Team identified earlier this year:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>WordPress events spark innovation and adoption by way of accessible training and networking for users, builders, designers, and extenders. We celebrate community by accelerating 21st-century skills, professional opportunities, and partnerships for WordPressers of today and tomorrow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Prospective event organizers who are inspired by the confirmed pilot events can submit their creative ideas via a <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/next-generation-of-wordpress-events\">dedicated form</a>.

I&#8217;m your guest host Chloé Bringmann. And here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro music)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have the privilege of guest hosting this episode of the WordPress Briefing. And today I have with me a very special guest. The Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, Angela Jin. Welcome. Before we dive into all the questions, can you tell me and our listeners a little bit about your role in the WordPress community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:01:01]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, happy to, and thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;m very excited to be here. I am the Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, and I provide oversight and guidance for our WordPress programs, such as our events programs, training, and Five for the Future, with an eye toward ensuring their sustainability and growth. I&#8217;m very fortunate to work with our contributors across many teams around the world. In addition to troubleshooting and helping folks figure out how to move forward, I also spend a good amount of time exploring with others what could be in our programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:01:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We just got back from WordCamp Europe in Athens, Greece. It was such an energizing event for me, but I&#8217;m curious about what your impressions were of the past week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:01:52]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it was fantastic. I&#8217;m always really inspired by what a group of like-minded people can achieve together. There&#8217;s a lot of passion for this particular WordCamp, and it made for a really wonderful WordPress experience. Full of lots of great connections and memories; I have a million follow-ups and probably even more thoughts to reflect on. So it&#8217;s great. There were a lot of new WordPressers there. So it was lovely to meet them. And I&#8217;m really excited to see how many exciting new projects and ideas that we have in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:02:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same, you said it perfectly. Josepha also mentioned in the flagship’s keynote, the proposal for the next generation of WordCamps. I&#8217;m curious about what the main ideas and goals, as discussed thus far, are of that proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:02:42]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For sure. So WordCamps have been fundamental for the WordPress community for a very long time. And while they have continued to grow larger and reach more places around the world, it&#8217;s also undeniable that the way that people meet has changed since 2006.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:01]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, just as WordPress itself iterates we&#8217;re looking at iterating on WordCamps so that they move from fundamental to indispensable for the WordPressers of today and tomorrow. So event attendees today are looking to learn essential skills, make connections that lead to neat opportunities, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to that end, we put forth an updated purpose for our events, which is that WordPress events spark innovation and adoption by way of accessible training and networking for users, builders, designers, and extenders. We celebrate community by accelerating 21st-century skills, professional opportunities, and partnerships for WordPressers of today and tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:47]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the goal here is to create events that are more clearly defined &#8211; who these are for what you will gain from attending. We are looking to see events that take a deeper dive into content, or topics and provide more advanced content. And let&#8217;s try out some different formats and see how that shapes our event experience. And so it is a big shift. And change is always hard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:04:13]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the feedback that I&#8217;ve gotten so far, and certainly at WordCamp Europe, is that this is a very welcome evolution. And the Community team has already received over 60 proposals. So I&#8217;m very excited about that. In fact, a WordPress Community Day in Rome has already been announced and is focused on providing meet-up organizing and community management skills. So that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Chloé Bringmann 00:04:37]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow, that&#8217;s incredible. I love that we&#8217;ve gotten 60 suggestions already and that we already have an event in place. That&#8217;s fantastic. In that blog post, too, it&#8217;s mentioned that WordCamps should prioritize inclusivity and diversity. How can organizers ensure these values are upheld in the next generation of WordCamps and beyond events? Into our day-to-day project involvement?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:04]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent question. So while WordCamps themselves are changing, some of our core values, like prioritizing inclusivity and diversity, are non-negotiable. For the whole project, we have a diversity, equity, and inclusion statement, and a Code of Conduct that lays out how we expect our community to engage with each other in this space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on top of that, our programs do focus on providing resources and training like how to create a diverse speaker roster. And we have diverse speaker training workshops on how to organize a diverse and inclusive WordPress event. And we also have a great list of third-party resources as well. And so, with so many events, we create a lot of opportunities to grow as a visible contributor, whether it is a speaker, a volunteer, or an organizer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:56]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so with the next generation of events, we could more intentionally create these spaces for groups that historically have been underrepresented. Even long before my post went live, the BlackPress meetup group, for example, wanted to create an event that connected with historically black colleges and universities. And an event like that that really invites a specific group to learn all about WordPress would be a really great experience and a wonderful way to celebrate that community and a great connection to the broader community so that we can intentionally get to the diversity that we want to see.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:06:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also want to add that the people who are underrepresented in our community are more likely to need financial sponsorship. And so even though we do keep our ticket prices low so that our events are more easily accessible, the cost of travel continues to increase, not to mention the time and energy required to participate in these events. So an excellent way that companies can help is to sponsor somebody&#8217;s time and somebody&#8217;s contributions, which we&#8217;re always trying to encourage through the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:07:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beautiful. So, with that in mind, how do you foresee the next generation of WordCamps impacting the WordPress community, that larger ecosystem? So, what changes do you hope to see regarding community engagement, learning opportunities, and best practices?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:07:31]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I foresee us evolving our tried and true event format into a dynamic wealth of community-led opportunities. I know that online events were pretty exhausting during the worst of the pandemic, but there is a ton of unexplored opportunities there. And community research is also showing that online is a great way to create more inclusive and diverse events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:07:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Training team, with their learn WordPress online workshops, have really led the way with our online events. And there are so many more people that we can reach there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:08:08]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in addition to providing more advanced content, I also hope to see content around broader tech and business trends that influence WordPress, and conversely, how WordPress can shape those trends as well. And with all of that, I really hope that we can bring in more community members that otherwise wouldn&#8217;t be interested in what we currently offer, especially a younger generation that will help us drive the next generation of WordPress, the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:08:39]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very excited to hear all of this, and I bet our listeners are too. I&#8217;m curious how they and community members can provide feedback or get involved with this next generation of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:08:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to encourage everyone, please come chat with the Community team and comment on the current posts. We really welcome your feedback to help us get our events to this next iteration of what they will become. There are two posts, in particular, one is to suggest ideas of event formats and topics that you would like to see. And the second is if you are an organizer, we&#8217;re inviting you to hear some recommendations for improved tooling that would be helpful for your event site. And we&#8217;ll include links to those posts in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:09:26]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One final question for you, Angela. Any thoughts as we prepare for WordCamp US and the Community Summit, which will be in National Harbor, Maryland, in August?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:09:37]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Community Summit in particular, if you want to attend and you haven&#8217;t already applied, please please do make sure to apply as soon as possible. And encourage somebody else who you think should attend to apply as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:09:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if financial constraints are a blocker, we are aiming to help with the cost of hotel and or flight. And so one way to help support the diversity and inclusion of this event, and really to the whole project, is to also contribute to the Community Summit travel fund. You can find information about all of that on the Community Summit site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:10:15]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And next, if you have a topic in mind that you think needs to be discussed at the Community Summit, please please also share that information with us as well. And last but not least, I am, I am so excited. I&#8217;m not going to spoil anything. But I have been working with the WordCamp US organizing team and looking at some of what they have planned and some of the content. It&#8217;s going to be a truly incredible event, so don&#8217;t miss out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:010:41]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wonderful. Thank you so much for joining me, Angela. And I can&#8217;t wait to see you and the WordPress community in August in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:010:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to our small list of big things. First up is the proposal and establishment of a new WordPress contributor team, the Sustainability team. Coming into WordCamp Europe, a proposal was put forward to create a team that would embed sustainable practices and processes in the ecosystem to ensure the Project&#8217;s longevity, both socially, economically, and as well environmentally. At WordCamp Europe, this proposal was confirmed, and the Sustainability team is now officially the 22nd contributor team that WordPressers can support with their contributions. Head on over to their making WordPress Slack channel, #sustainability, and join the conversation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:011:39]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, I would like to call your attention to the 6.4 development cycle post that was published on June 5th. 6.4 will be the third major release of 2023 and supports our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts by being led by those contributors that identify as underrepresented gender. This release will also be the first to kick off phase three of the Gutenberg roadmap, which is collaborative editing and workflows. I&#8217;ve included a link to the post in our show notes and encourage anyone who is interested in being part of this momentous release to join us in making this both impactful and meaningful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:012:16]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, WordCamp US, as discussed, will be upon us before we know it starting on August 24th at National Harbor, Maryland. While tickets may be sold out, volunteers are still very much needed to make the flagship event run smoothly.

In today&#8217;s show, we will talk about Gutenberg 15.9 and 6.0 releases, new posts from the developer block, the roadmap for 6.3 and a little bit of WordCamp Europe. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and the WordPress developer advocate and a full-time core contributor to the WordPress open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have the wonderful pleasure to have Isabel Brison with me on the show. And Isabel has been a designer, developer on the Block Editor for almost four years, I think. And is the editor tech co-lead for WordPress 6.3, and therefore knows quite a bit about the features coming to WordPress 6.3. Isabel, thank you so much for making the time today to be on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, it&#8217;s a great pleasure. Thanks for inviting me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We are both on the 6.3 release squad. So you are the tech colleague for the editor, together with Ramon Dodd. I&#8217;m on the team of editor triage with Nick Diego, Anne McCarthy and Firoz Sabaliya. Both of us, Firoz and I, are first-timers on this release squad, team four editor triage. So that&#8217;s going to be interesting. And we are less than two weeks before beta one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: We are indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: What&#8217;s happening in a release cycle before beta one and what after?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: So right now, from an editor tech lead perspective, what happens before beta one is we need to make sure that all the latest changes from Gutenberg plugin, so more than from the plugin itself, from the Gutenberg repo where all the cutting-edge stuff is being worked on. All those changes have to be transported into the core repo, which is a different repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So part of that process is automated. I say all the changes, but in reality, it&#8217;s all the changes that are stable enough to make it into core. Because in Gutenberg, there&#8217;s a lot of experimental stuff that is not necessarily ready for core yet. And so part of the process is that the editor tech lead, in this case, the leads, because there are two of us, we have to make sure that the right changes are being put into core, that everything is working well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of that process is you can say automated because essentially, in Gutenberg, you have a lot of JavaScript which is published as NPM packages and/or consumes those packages. So that part of the process is you update the packages, you publish the packages, the latest versions. And then we update the packages in the core repo to get those latest versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there&#8217;s also a fair amount of PHP in Gutenberg, and that part needs to be transported across to the other repo manually. And so that&#8217;s where we have to go through all the changes that require adding PHP to core and do pull requests for each change set and review them and commit them individually. So depending on how many changes, and we&#8217;re talking&#8230; So Gutenberg has been growing a fair bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a lot of contributors now, and so there&#8217;s a lot of changes in each release. And so this process can become a bit overwhelming if there&#8217;s a lot of stuff. And now we&#8217;re counting down to beta and going, &#8220;Oh, we need to get all the back ports in, in time before beta and in time, preferably, to be able to test them a bit in core and check everything&#8217;s okay before beta&#8217;s cut.&#8221; So that&#8217;s the path of the process that we&#8217;re at now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So there&#8217;s a lot of shifting around and talking to contributors and testing as well maybe beforehand. Is there also a process to audit some of the experimental APIs that are there if they can be made stable?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Because that was one of the contentions that sometimes experimental stuff gets into core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: So that&#8217;s also something that occurs before each release. There&#8217;ll be an audit in Gutenberg of all the experimental APIs. So this is interesting. This situation of the experimental APIs has evolved a bit over time. So previously, up until, I want to say maybe a year ago, but I have a very, very hazy sense of time. So it might be more or less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were a lot of experimental APIs that would be merged into core because they were part of a Gutenberg feature that was considered stable enough. The feature itself was considered stable enough to move into core, although the API had not been marked stable. And so in practice, there&#8217;s a fair few experimental APIs that are public. And because they have made it into core at some point in the past, we now have to support them indefinitely because there are extenders out there using them in the real world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can&#8217;t scrap them, we can&#8217;t make changes to them. And so essentially, they are stable but there&#8217;s a lot of them. And there&#8217;s some progress, slow progress in marking things stable for each release but we have to go through a lot of APIs. So every time before the release, I feel like this work should be done maybe a bit more in advance as opposed to being a month earlier or three weeks before beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because by that time, everyone&#8217;s just super busy with, &#8220;Oh, but we need to get this feature finished and we need to make sure this is working. We need to fix all these bugs to make sure that this feature&#8217;s stable enough to make it into core.&#8221; And at that point in time, no one is concerned about whether the APIs are marked experimental or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the good improvement that we had a while ago was that a new system was introduced into Gutenberg that allows us to export experimental APIs as private. And so that means from a package, there&#8217;s a bunch of private APIs. And they can be used in another package, but they are not made available to the general public. And that makes it safer to have these APIs be experimental for a while longer and be able to make changes to them without having to provide the indefinite back compatibility for something that we, at some point, realized was not the right API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is all work in progress. So I did that audit recently, and what I noticed is that there are not that many. Now that we have this mechanism that allows us to mark APIs private, we&#8217;re not actually putting any new experimental APIs into core. The ones that are already there, though that&#8217;s another matter, we progressively stabilized. But it is definitely a work in progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s awesome. And I think for the show notes, there was a process and that was proposed at the Make blog a while ago. You&#8217;re right, I think it was almost a year ago. And I have the feeling that about three or four months ago, Adam Zelensky, who was one of the drivers of this new feature or new method on how to handle experimental APIs now, he has published a progress report on how that&#8217;s working now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for the listeners who are interested into getting really into the nitty-gritty of it, that is definitely two posts for you to read. So now just for the people that don&#8217;t know you, you have been a guest on Gutenberg Times Live Q&amp;A in January, and you were talking about layouts. How is the work progressing? And how was your talk at WordCamp Asia? So I&#8217;m just getting some of our listeners caught up with you and what happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: That seems like an eternity ago, WordCamp Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Don&#8217;t I know it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Back in February. Yeah, it was. And so what happened is, layout is progressing slowly. So there are a few small enhancements that are going to be going into core 6.3. One of the things that I actually just merged this PR earlier, which is to stabilize the layout support. So the layout was one of those experimental APIs that have been in core for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because they have been there for a while and they&#8217;re actually being used in production by a few plugins, they are de facto stable because we do have to provide that compatibility for them. So it becomes absurd at that point to still have the API marked experimental. So layout has just been stabilized. I guess that&#8217;s the big news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean anything in terms of features. Literally, it&#8217;s just the tag. The experimental tag is no longer there. I hope that going forward, this is going to give folks more confidence that they can use layout in third party extensions and it works. It would&#8217;ve worked anyway because we did have to provide those assurances already. But it&#8217;s good to have it officially stable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. Congratulations, so to speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You were also talking about working on the grid layouts. I have seen there are still experiments. Well, now that you are part of the release cycle there until the release, you probably are not going to be able to work on that. So do you think that&#8217;s going to get into 6.4 or that it&#8217;s progressing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: So that&#8217;s a good question. So grid layout. So what happens is a new layout has been created, it&#8217;s available. So through the layout API that is no longer experimental, anyone can now use a layout add. So add layout support to a block. Say you&#8217;re building a custom block, you can add layout support to it and you can make that layout be of type grid. So that is already available in the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what is marked experimental, and will not be shipped in 6.3, is the group grid variation. So the group block has a few different layout variations, and behind an experimental flag in the plugin, there is a grid variation for the group block. However, that hasn&#8217;t been marked stable yet because what we have currently, the grid layout is a very basic version. It&#8217;s a very basic type of layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of features to grid, there are a lot of very interesting and good thoughts out there about how we can build on it and create awesome tools so people can build really cool grid layouts. However, we only really have that basic structure that gives you a grid layout without any real possibility of configuring for the child lock. So if you want them to occupy one space in the grid, two or three, which is what really gives grid all of its flexibility, is that ability to manipulate and decide where the children are going to sit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for now, that group grid variation is not going to ship, but grid is actually going to ship in the post template block as a layout variation for post template. So we previously had in the query block the command&#8230; The controls are actually in the query block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you could choose between a list or a grid layout type of query. But what those controls were doing were actually setting a kind of custom layout in the post template block. And because it was a custom implementation, there was no possibility to add a block space and control to it. And because people really need to have the ability to change block spacing and post template, we did the refactor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now post template is using actual layout support, so block spacing can be set on it. And so behind the scenes, it still has the custom toolbar control where you can choose between a list or a grid type layout. So the exposure of actual grid layout controls is kind of limited, but it is using grids. So technically, yes, there is one lot that is shipping with grid layout in 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Well, that was the catch-up with Isabel Brison on the layout. So thank you so much. So let&#8217;s go a little bit further into our show here today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have another announcement. Since the last Gutenberg Changelog, there were five new posts on the developer block. And one was just published this week that&#8217;s, &#8220;What&#8217;s New for Developers?&#8221; by Justin Tadlock. And that&#8217;s the fifth installment of the monthly roundup showcasing features that are specific for theme and plugin developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it focused a little bit on the 6.3 development cycle. It&#8217;s more like you can test it now, so your plugin and your theme will be compatible when 6.3 comes out, or just make sure that it doesn&#8217;t break kind of list. But it has a lot more other things in there. Ryan Welcher published a tutorial on how to use the block inspector sidebar groups that came in with 6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, as a developer, you have more control over the custom controls that should be appearing in the&#8230; Inspector controls are what&#8217;s showing in the sidebar, just to place that in the canvas where you see all those custom controls. So if you want to, as a plugin developer, add additional controls to, say, the dimensions, you can group the interface for that to show up in the style tab, in the dimension block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he has some nice code examples in there. Justin Tadlock also published customizing core block style variations in theme.json. And it&#8217;s a walkthrough through the block styles directly in theme.json. Instead of using them in a custom style sheet, you can centralize all the things a little bit more in the theme.json. Curating the editor experience with client-side filters, post by Nick Diego, shows off also the new filters that were introduced in 6.2 and how you can change the editor experience with new client-side JavaScript filters, and has some great examples there for your block development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then lastly, the first one is useentityrecords hook as an easier way to fetch WordPress data, by Michael Burridge. And it&#8217;s part out of the WordPress data package and core data packages. And the hook has been extremely useful to fetching and working with data in your block development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this tutorial shows you how it&#8217;s easier to use entity records instead of the getEntityRecords from the data package. This only is for developers of course, it&#8217;s to develop a new block. So it won&#8217;t help anybody who is a no-coder. But you know that you can curate the editor experience or your developer can curate the editor experience. It&#8217;s something that you can, as a project manager, definitely learn more about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Good stuff. There&#8217;s a lot of features here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We&#8217;re all catching up on quite a few things to make it easier to do block development, and the theme development and also augment the dev notes that certainly talked about the new groups for the inspector controls or through the client-side filters but not as deeply enough. Sometimes it&#8217;s really hard to get the exact use case, or if you don&#8217;t have examples for various use cases, to get it into an idea and how to use it in your project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 15.9</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us to what&#8217;s released. Then we are tackling first the Gutenberg 15.9 release that&#8217;s from May 31st, by about two weeks ago. And it included 171 PRs merged into this release from 58 contributors. Seven of them were first-timers, and Carlos Bravo was a release lead and author of the release post. So let&#8217;s dive in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are enhancements that you can now have block variations transformations in the block switcher. So what does that mean? It means that when you have the inserter and you want to do a transform, you can also offer the block variations from it, if I understood this correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: The block switcher is in the block toolbar, correct? It&#8217;s in the block toolbar. When you click on the block icon, you get a list of the possible transforms. So apart from other blocks that you can transform the block to, you would get variations of the same block also as possible transformations, which I feel existed at some point in the past and then was removed. And that has been re-added. I&#8217;m not sure. I might be wrong on this. I just have a vague feeling that this is familiar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it sounds really familiar. I don&#8217;t know if it actually includes the styles as well. Because the styles are on the right-hand side and you have to now&#8230; But it doesn&#8217;t. So it&#8217;s the block variations because the blocks&#8217; variation have other names. But they were actually organized in the transformations further down with the prioritization. You probably can get them higher up in the block switcher. So this is definitely something I would support even if it went back and come back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, makes it easy. And you get style variations too for blocks that have style variations. This is actually pretty neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And you don&#8217;t have to open up the site, but to just get the style variations in there. Next thing up would be that the code block now has wide align support. And that is really good because sometimes the line in a code block is creating horizontal navigation bars, horizontal scroll bars. And now, with the wide support, you can make it a little wider and have that one line not remove the horizontal scroll bar, which is a better reading experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good aesthetic improvement too. It can be nice to have wide code windows so you can read the whole thing in one go without having to scroll.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Do you want to take the next one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: What&#8217;s the next one? I wanted to mention that in 5.9 a PR was merged that removed the post content block from the list of blocks that can be inserted in the post editor. And that makes sense because the post editor is basically what we get inside the post content block. So if you tried to add a post content block to the post editor, it was getting an error, which was a really bad user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the block was rightfully removed. But in the meantime, someone noticed that there was a possible use case for the post content in the post editor because we can add query blocks in the post editor. So inside your post, you could have a little query with some categories or something like that. And there is a legitimate use case for having the post content block sit inside the query, and so inside the post template that you have inside the query.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because if you have short posts, if you have a custom post type that&#8217;s fairly short, you might want to actually show the whole post in there. And so a PR was quickly done to fix this and allow for that use case. I don&#8217;t think it went into&#8230; It didn&#8217;t. No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: For sure, it didn&#8217;t go into 16.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think it did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: It is going to go out into&#8230; It did? I&#8217;m pretty sure that it was only merged yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, okay. And it didn&#8217;t-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; It wasn&#8217;t backported. No. So it will come back for 16.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: So in 16.1, we will be able to use post content inside queries inside the post editor, which is pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: One other use case is from a different custom post types, you want to show some of the posts in there and in your blog post. And there are many use cases I can think of it when you wanted to query something else and need to post content in there. So the next one is the Wayfinder or Command. I think there&#8217;s still a discussion going on on the naming of the feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wayfinder was also not the one that was&#8230; It feels right for me, but I&#8217;m kind of English Westerners. But in the eastern hemisphere, it was a little bit differently seen. And for translated, it was really hard to find a good way. So the discussion goes on. But in the meantime, the Command&#8217;s API has marked in public, so you can use it and test it for your plugin or your WordPress install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Riad Benguella&#8217;s post Command Center request for feedback also contains some code examples on how to use the API. And you can create static commands, dynamic commands or contextual commands. And so you can try it out and see what it all does for you. It&#8217;s like a search bar that you don&#8217;t have to go through. You click control K, and then a search bar comes up on the interface and then you can type in some search commands. And it gives you a list of items that you can do, like add page or add post or something like that. Have you played with it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: It&#8217;s really cool. It kind of reminds me of the Spotlight on the Mac. I don&#8217;t know if Spotlight is the best name for it, but in my head, I&#8217;m calling it Spotlight. Because basically, it just pops up, this bar in the middle, and you can search for stuff and you can do stuff from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is great. I wanted to add that I think possibly also in 5.9, there was a PR that added the ability to invoke the Command Center by clicking on the template name at the top of the site editor. So that&#8217;s just another super practical shortcut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, 15.9. So what else is in there? The interactivity API is still in experiments. And do you want to talk about the lightbox and the directives?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. I thought I&#8217;d mentioned it because it&#8217;s super exciting. It&#8217;s still very, very experimental. At this stage, it is unlikely to make it into 6.3, which on one hand, I&#8217;m slightly sad because lightboxes for images are really cool. On the other hand, it is still behind an experimental flag in the plugin. It hasn&#8217;t actually seen a lot of real-world testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s also good to get some testing done before actually merging the feature into core. It&#8217;s very new, it&#8217;s very promising. So the whole interactivity API is a really interesting piece that&#8217;s been worked on for ages. It seems like ages. I don&#8217;t know. It can&#8217;t be that long. But I&#8217;m so excited about it because it provides a really neat way of adding interactive behaviors that&#8217;s usually only achievable with JavaScript to playing blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s going to add a bunch of behaviors out of the box for core blocks, but it&#8217;s also going to be possible to use that API in the future to create custom behaviors for custom blocks. So it&#8217;s just a really nice way of standardizing a way of adding JavaScript to blocks to create dynamic behaviors. And the first experimental one or the first experiments to be put out there in the plugin is the possibility to add a lightbox to images. So if you enable it, you can click on the image in the front-end and then the image just pops up in full screen kind of thing, which is pretty neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I know that Luis Herranz did a workshop at WordCamp Europe last week. There was quite some buzz around the interactivity API. Because it mostly is also in the PHP render file where you can just add the directives or add the call for the directives. So it gets a lot of PHP developers also excited about block development and adding the interactivity to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the excitement is also around being able&#8230; which is not going to be in the first version, even if it makes it into 6.4, that you can actually create your own directives. So the core will come out with, I don&#8217;t know, 15 or 20 directives that have a lot of use cases, cover probably 80% what a developer would need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the combination of it, be it data binding, be it button actions, being other interactivity. So this is a really exciting feature to come to block development. And I think it&#8217;s one of the missing links to get other people excited about building with blocks and JavaScript. And get the first vendor with PHP and then have the client-side changes through the API is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. Cool. My cat just popped in. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The cat. So the next thing is that the text formatting tools in a paragraph have now two new attributes added. That&#8217;s the long language, so L-A-N-G, and the D-I-R, the dir attributes, which helps with multilingual posts. So you can add a language like French or Italian IT to a paragraph, and then a signal to the assistant technologies and the reader, &#8220;Okay, this is a different language.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the dir part is that you change left to right, right to left rendering of that. And the code, almost verbatim, is used from Jean-Baptiste Audras, who had a plugin that added those two formatting tools to the paragraph.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the subsequent PR also now uses the bidirectional text override element from Mozilla. But it&#8217;s good to have these additional formatting tools in there to cater to the multilingual content that you find all over Europe. So this is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Not only is this really cool, but I am fairly certain that this is a longstanding issue from the accessibility audit way back when that the last time I checked was still open. So it might be a good idea to go over there and see if that issue can now be closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But now it can be closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Super exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That was definitely a missing piece. And that was also the reason why Jean-Baptiste added that to his companies or that his company built the plugin to help their clients with that kind of formatting. So there is a new API to allow prioritization of inserter items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a block list setting, you now can allow the parent blocks define the priority for the blocks that are allowed in it, and how the inserter displays them for the inner blocks of that parent block. So that is definitely another customization and curation tool for the extenders with their block development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, yeah. For sure. That will be great to provide more custom user experiences for certain block types. Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think we need to somewhere create a list of all the extension possibilities because I don&#8217;t think there is an overall list of all the possibilities on how to extend now. Sometimes there&#8217;s still missing documentation there of course. Not of course. But I found that some of the extensibilities like the inspector controls, the documentation&#8217;s in the README for the source code component but doesn&#8217;t bubble up into the developer handbook of the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I know that Nick Diego and Ryan are working on that together with Michael to figure out this architecture of missing stuff. Next thing is it sounds really benign, renaming template parts to library. So in the side editor on the left-hand side, there was a menu item called template parts. And that will be renamed into library because it will also house reusable blocks and patterns, reusable patterns or sync patterns, I think they&#8217;re called.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The template parts, of course, will be also underneath it. I don&#8217;t know how far the syncing of pattern or reusable block is going because there&#8217;s a lot of confusion since the beginning: what is a pattern? What is a reusable block? And what is the template part? And they sound to be the same, but they all have one thing different of them. And there is an effort to unify it a little bit, and just manage what&#8217;s different instead of have three different items for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I think that that would be great because reusable blocks are essentially patterns or they were already working as patterns, although they have the block itself. When you create a reusable block, it&#8217;s frozen, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: If you make changes to it, you&#8217;re making changes to all reusable blocks to the content. Whereas patterns, you drop a pattern in somewhere and you make changes to it and you can continue using that pattern elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But yet there&#8217;s this big problem that when you have a pattern and you change the design of the pattern, you cannot go back and have that change as well on all the time all the uses that you had, because there is no record of a post using a pattern. Because once it&#8217;s in the canvas, it just is the blocks that are inside the patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. So I think the fundamental piece here is being able to have patterns where the design can be changed globally, even if the content of the pattern is individual to each instance. And it&#8217;s a pretty complex piece of work. It&#8217;s being actively worked on. There is, I think, an effort to consolidate reusable blocks and patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think the idea is going to be that reusable blocks are going to be absorbed and become patterns of a type. But it&#8217;s still fairly early stages considering the complexity of the endeavor. So at this point, it&#8217;s not certain what, if anything, of that work will actually make it into 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I can see that. And because the reusable blocks have actually also an interface to edit them, which the patterns do not. And that&#8217;s also something: how can you make those editing interfaces be used for both of them? There are a lot of different things that need to be aligned differently to make it all work, and I think it&#8217;s a fairly complex thing. Yes, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the next part for 15.9 is that the global styles get revisions. And that has been on the feedback list and on the wish list of a lot of people who have participated in the Full Site Editing Outreach program and have been very faithful in doing all the testing, the calls for testing and having a revision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you know that when you change colors and font settings and things, you don&#8217;t know what you get until you see what you get. You don&#8217;t know what you want until you see what you get. And then all of a sudden, &#8220;Oh, maybe I liked that previously better.&#8221; But then you don&#8217;t remember the combination of what it was. And now you have revisions and you can see them side by side. So this is a very exciting new feature that will come in, and it seems to be making to 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, yeah. That one has been merged and it&#8217;s definitely going to make it into 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: There might be UI changes, but it will show up in the styles right-hand side and the sidebar under revisions. And then you get a list of all the revisions in the canvas and you can see them all together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: So you can access the dark sidebar on the left-hand side. If you go to the styles and you see if the theme has style variations, they&#8217;ll appear there. But also in the right-hand side, global style sidebar, you can also access the revisions on the styles actions. There&#8217;s a little button at the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yes. Under the experiments of 15.9, there is a list items called the behaviors UI. And that&#8217;s part of the interactivity API, I believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And that is kind of a standardized way to attach behavior to an element or something like that. As I said, it&#8217;s in the experiments and I think it&#8217;s part of the lightbox behavior. That&#8217;s the only behavior that&#8217;s available right now. But what else can you think about what this could do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yes, I believe so. So say that you can define certain types of interactivity for certain blocks as, for example, the image can have a lightbox, but we don&#8217;t want all images on the site to suddenly have lightboxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the behaviors UI is something that it provides website authors, users with a way of enabling those interactive behaviors or disabling them for any given block. So it&#8217;s an important piece because certain behaviors might not be applicable to all blocks on the site and you need to have a way of turning them on and off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And so that will be part of the advanced interface on a block-based level in the sidebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. Currently, it sits under advanced in the block sidebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, this concludes our changelog for 15.9.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gutenberg 16.0</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And now this week, 16.0 was released and Nick Diego was the release lead, and he wrote also the post. And it had 164 pull requests by 54 contributors. So it&#8217;s always a good size of contributors adding code to things. And there were four first-timers as well. And this comes with one feature we are all excited about. But do you want to take us into it, Isabel?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. So the feature that we&#8217;re all excited about, there&#8217;s actually a couple of features that we&#8217;re all excited about. One of them is the ability to add new pages from the site editor directly. Now a disclaimer, the ability is to add draft pages, not to publish them directly. But that&#8217;s great because the first thing that you do when you add pages, work on it is a draft, and then only afterwards you publish it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s good. It&#8217;s the start of being able to do everything, having the site editor as the center from which you can do anything to your site, including create pages, edit them possibly at some point in the future, publish them. So that&#8217;s a pretty great new feature to have. It can be accessed from the left-hand sidebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The new page also helps when you create new navigation menu where you want to access or point to a page that doesn&#8217;t exist yet. So this certainly helps as well. And I saw some discussion around it for that to work well and it show up in the list of searches that the page is actually published. So it&#8217;s the question, &#8220;What is a good way to move forward?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what I am really excited about is that I can now edit a page in its context and I see how it works in context of the template. So I see the header, I see the footer, I see if there is a sidebar and how my content behaves that I create for the page. It allows me. And I know from the feedback of the Full Site Editing program, there was quite some feedback that there is a confusion between, &#8220;Am I adding the page or am I adding the template?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And some people edited the template thinking it was a page, and then found that edited piece or that added piece on every single page because they inadvertently changed the template. So the possibility was taking out of the site editor, but it&#8217;s coming back now with some guardrails. So you know when you edit a template, all of a sudden, the title changes to page title instead of saying about us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it also highlights that you are editing now a template part instead of the page itself. So I think we are getting really closer to have more a unified system of editing and not having to switch out from the site editor to the post editor and back in the admin where you have multiple back steps to get to the old page editing screens. So I&#8217;m really excited about to get this all in one interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: So that&#8217;s the second feature, what I was saying when I said there were two features. New pages, but also the ability to be able to tell at a glance if what we&#8217;re editing is the page&#8217;s actual content or the page&#8217;s template. So now it&#8217;s only possible to either edit one or the other, but not both simultaneous setting. That&#8217;s a pretty good one to have in there because otherwise it would be extremely confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. And then there were a few, I don&#8217;t want to say small changes because it definitely takes an effort to get it in. But the list view got two additional, I would say, quality of life changes, the dragging. So you can now drag outside the immediate area and get into a different drop zone element there. And it&#8217;s now easier to position a block on top or on the bottom of the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before, it was really hard to get on the bottom of a list when you drag and dropped it. And then the other one is that sometimes in the list view, your container blocks collapsed. And when you dragged a new block into that container, it always put it on the top. Now it makes more sense to put it on the bottom because I added to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you open up the collapsed block again, you have all the new containers or blocks that you dragged into it on the bottom of the group block, for instance. So I really like those features. They make it much easier to be a little bit more predictable in what you&#8217;re doing and behave like that as you think it would. Intuition is an interesting thing. Sometimes you get it right, but sometimes you get it wrong, and 50/50 is a pretty good ratio for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, true. And it often takes a few iterations to figure out what the best behavior is and what&#8217;s most intuitive because it&#8217;s not always obvious. When you&#8217;re conceptualizing something, you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s build this new feature. It&#8217;s going to work like this.&#8221; But then in practice, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, actually that doesn&#8217;t work very well at all.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So what else is in there? So I stopped at the details block. The experimental flag for the details block was removed and the blocks itself was stabilized. Now you have the two elements: the summary and the details. You can certainly style them accordingly. And now you can also add them to your canvas and it works out of the box. So this is more, it&#8217;s a block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we talked about it before, I think, in last episode as well as the one before. Because it was experimental and we were kind of going back and forth on it. It&#8217;s the block where you can use it as a spoiler alert. You can hide the details of your movie review that would spoil for those who haven&#8217;t seen the movie, spoil the movie ending or that part. Or if it&#8217;s just minutiae detail that only two or three readers would need, you can hide them in the details block, and then you get an error to expand it into the details from the summary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: That&#8217;s pretty cool block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it was long in the making. It will make it into 6.3. I think there are two other blocks that are on the verge in core, but I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re going to make it. The one is the table of contents block, and the other one is the footnotes block or blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: That&#8217;s sad. Those were really useful blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It doesn&#8217;t seem&#8230; There wasn&#8217;t any movement on the table of contents block for about a month. So I&#8217;m not sure that anybody takes it on because there are two things that still need to be done there. And the footnotes block, I think Ella is working on that. And she is having two different variations where that needs to be a decision, which one will be pursued or not. And with two weeks to go, it might be a little bit tight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: And it&#8217;s not two weeks, it&#8217;s closer to one week actually because for the packages&#8230; So for all the JavaScript pieces, what happens is we&#8217;re going to grab the release candidate for the next Gutenberg plugin release, which is going to be 16.1. And publish the packages from the release candidates with any bug fixes that are necessary after RC is cut. And those updated packages are what&#8217;s going to make it into core before beta one. And because the RC is going to be created towards….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: &#8230; the end of next week. It would usually be on a Wednesday. It is likely at this point that it&#8217;s going to be Thursday or Friday. Given that both editor tech leads for this release are in Australia, we can conceivably do it on our Friday morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that gives a little bit of extra time. It&#8217;s still Thursday night, everywhere else in the world. So at this point, that is likely to be the plan. And so what&#8217;s going to make it into beta one is anything that can be merged until that date, which is essentially one week away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s one week away. We are recording this on June 15th, and beta one is the 27th. But the next release candidate, that&#8217;s going to be the 23rd or the 24th. So continuing with 16.0, thank you for this explanation on how tight it actually is with the timeframe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: No worries. We&#8217;re glad to throw everyone into panic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: High alert. So the query pagination block, another feature is that you can hide the label text for the next and previous. You have three choices: you can have an error, you can have carets or you can have text and now you can have both. But you can hide the previous text for it and just have the errors. So that&#8217;s a feature that is on par with the query pagination form classic themes, which is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I highlighted one other thing, and it&#8217;s only really relevant for developers that want to get into how to use the HTML tag processor, Jeff Ong refactored the search block to actually use the HTML tag processor. And I think it&#8217;s a good case study on how this actually makes it easier or more readable to use the HTML tag processor instead of rejects in PHP. So I think it&#8217;s the PR51273, if you just want to get up and listen to this, get up and look at it. Of course, it&#8217;s in the Changelog 16.0. Have you worked with the HTML tag processor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, I used it a while ago to do some layout-related stuff. So I think I actually was the first person to use that API in Gutenberg. It was still in Gutenberg, hadn&#8217;t been in motion to call yet and it was just being worked on by a few folks. And I was doing a layout-related task where it was trying to add the layout, the class.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in a block when you have layout support, you get class names that will say what kind of layout it is, and then you can hook styles to them and stuff. And most blocks just have one wrapper. Blocks that have inner blocks have wrapper, inner blocks. But there are some blocks that have a bit more of a complex markup structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the idea was that the layout classes should be added to the inner wrapper so that they can have an effect over the inner blocks of the block. And that was a piece where I found using the HTML tag process, it was super handy because I had to locate the inner wrapper of a given block. So that was a great API. It is really, really helpful for that kind of work with PHP when you have to go digging around for some HTML and you don&#8217;t want to use rejects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think it&#8217;s not tied to WordPress. You actually can use it in any PHP code, so reaching out to the bigger universe outside of WordPress. It&#8217;s definitely an enhancement of the language as well. So another line item from the Changelog is that the post template now has block spacing and layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, I did that one actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Congratulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Well, it went through a few iterations. It was one of those PRs that end up taking a month and have 80 comments on them. Well, maybe not 80 comments, but there was a fair amount of reviews and re-reviews and, &#8220;Should we do it this way? Should we do it that way?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Backwards compatibility was a concern because the blocks in production, there are lots of websites using it, so you can&#8217;t break stuff for real-world users. But it&#8217;s done and pretty happy with it. We talked about it a bit earlier. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s probably necessary to go through what it does again. But I think there&#8217;s a lot of folks who are going to be happy with this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I think that answer shows it&#8217;s kind of one answer that I had conversations with people at WordCamp Europe, and it&#8217;s one question I also gathered at WordCamp Asia. And it&#8217;s really hard to answer it because the question is, &#8220;When are design decisions made and who makes them?&#8221; And it&#8217;s very hard to explain that iterative process of developing these new features that haven&#8217;t been in WordPress before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is an initial design that comes from the design team, but then all subsequent is iteration on how the flow is going to be. And as you said, there are 80 comments there, so that it&#8217;s definitely a community approach to it, or at least a subset of developers trying to figure that out in a team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And testing comes about, and then there&#8217;s going back to the drawing board and then start again. So there is not really that one decision-maker and that one design that is zeroed in on. It&#8217;s more really what the idea was, and then we do the implementation. And then it&#8217;s how it works in context with the other things and it needs to be adopted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: It&#8217;s very much a process. And depending on the complexity for any big piece, you&#8217;ll have a bunch of discussion even before the thing is built. And then, while it&#8217;s being built, there might even be more than one PR, there might be, &#8220;PR one, this approach.&#8221; And then, &#8220;Ah, but there&#8217;s another approach that we could try. Let&#8217;s do another PR and try it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then people will test and compare the PRs. And we are a very opinionated community, I&#8217;ll tell you that. People will jump on and review and critique and give opinions and go, &#8220;Ah, this is not going to work for this case. And what about this plugin that break things for them?&#8221; And then after all that discussion, something will be agreed. It&#8217;s slowly chipping away and finding a way forward when it&#8217;s, &#8220;Okay, can&#8217;t do this because blah, can&#8217;t do that. I&#8217;ll maybe try that. Okay, that works. That works in testing. Let&#8217;s try it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the good thing about Gutenberg, about the plugin and this process of working experimentally is that you can merge something into the plugin and try it out, review cycles. And then get feedback from the extremely vocal and passionate community that we have, which I&#8217;m super thankful for. It&#8217;s great to be working on a project and have people just go and, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s amazing,&#8221; or &#8220;Oh, sorry, that doesn&#8217;t work for me. We really need to do that instead.&#8221; And you always know where you are. You know, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ve done this thing. That worked. Well, maybe that didn&#8217;t work so well, we&#8217;ll need to iterate on it and do something else.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But sometimes it can be a little tedious, I give you that. But I think the product gets better for it when everybody starts, opens the listening ears and kind of see, &#8220;Okay. Yeah, that&#8217;s certainly valid and I see that use case. And let&#8217;s see if we can include it into the design and into the feature.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, yeah. For sure. And because no one person knows everything, you build a feature, you have your own view of how that feature&#8217;s going to work. And then someone else has a completely different view. And it&#8217;s by getting a lot of different views that we manage to do things that lots of people can use in different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So that answers some of the questions, but maybe not in that way those who ask those questions actually like it. Maybe they just want somebody to blame or something like that. I don&#8217;t know what motivates that kind of question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I don&#8217;t know. And sometimes things are subjective. And working on layout-related features, I can tell you that everyone has their opinion on how it should work. And sometimes opinions are clashing because one person thinks it should work this way and another thinks it should work that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody&#8217;s right, nobody&#8217;s wrong. We just have to try and figure out which approach is going to satisfy the majority of use cases. It&#8217;s impossible to build a tool that will do every single thing. So it&#8217;s kind of what works best for the most people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Alone the decision to have the toolbar on top or on the block. I don&#8217;t know if the community is 50/50 split, but some people like the toolbar directly on top of the canvas, and some people like it to be close to the block that they are just editing on. But it could also be situational. And these design decisions, it&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s then kind of, &#8220;Okay. What&#8217;s the design of the feature to change the setting?&#8221; It gets you into to the next conversation with other people about a feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s an iterative process and it gets better and better while listening and trying to get it in. So on 6.0, I think we are almost through. We already talked about the Command Center, making the command selectors and actions as well for the public API. And then there is one bug fix that I like to point out, is the fix, the multi-entity, multi-property undo and redo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that is something that really we are waiting for quite a bit that when you highlight something and you delete it and you do undo, you only get one back or two back, but not all of it, for instance. And you cannot redo it because it didn&#8217;t have a memory of what the other properties were. And that has been fixed. And it really happened, and it happened to me, and I think it happened to anybody who experimented with multi-selection at one point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So this is fixed and I just wanted to point out, &#8220;Yay.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a great fix. Really needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Say again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Really needed, as in a necessary fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I think that was it from the 6.0 release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us to the active development or What&#8217;s Discussed section. And I had the idea to actually go to the roadmap of 6.3 and look at things that will make it into 6.3 and two and what&#8217;s not done yet. But there are a lot of links there. And we definitely know that the new blocks&#8217; table of content footnotes are probably not going to make it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also the introducing UI to safe patterns or all the things around patterns. I&#8217;m a little bit doubtful that we see some of the additional equation flows for patterns in that, what&#8217;s on the roadmap and what already happened but it&#8217;s not part of WordPress 6.3, is the curation filter in the pattern directory. So some core contributors went through the public pattern directory and created a few patterns as well under the WordPress moniker or user account, and then added that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you go to the pattern directory, you now have not only the categories there, like header or buttons or text or images. You also have a dropdown to select between curated and community. And the curated are the best of the best. Some of the community contributors or WordPress contributors think that those should be highlighted a little bit better or higher or are created by WordPress core contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that filter is available now on the pattern directory. It does not yet seem to make it into the pattern inserter that you can do that. But that is definitely on the roadmap, but it&#8217;s not yet done. So I think that the stabilization and usability of the toolbar, the list view and the link control UI, custom list views and library management, those things are almost done going into 6.3. But there is the box shadow component. I think that has already been merged from the design tools. No, that hasn&#8217;t yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, I think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That hasn&#8217;t yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: It hasn&#8217;t? Oh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, the box shadow that you can attach it to all the blocks I think is the one. There are box shadows enabled for certain blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, got it. I&#8217;m not 100% sure of the status of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And the style block is exposed in the style preview, I think, and details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. There seems to still be an active tracking issue here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So it takes a little longer. I think we make this for once we know when beta comes in, what is actually in the release of the features that made it. So in two weeks, when 16.1 stable comes out that&#8217;s passed the beta one release, I think our Changelog, the show will go through the roadmap and check off all the things that come and didn&#8217;t make it into 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we have a better conversation than doing it now in just projecting or estimating. And I&#8217;m very bad at predicting. My crystal ball is really in the shop, so I didn&#8217;t know where to go with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Predictions are always hard. And I think you kind of have to be in-depth knowledgeable about the work that&#8217;s being done. But if you&#8217;re just looking from outside and trying to have a bird&#8217;s eye view here of seeing what&#8217;s going into the release, it&#8217;s impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just have to go and ping people what I&#8217;ve been doing these past few weeks going, &#8220;Oh, hi. What do you think about this feature? Will it make it in? Are you happy to continue working on it? Is it mergeable within the next week or so?&#8221; That kind of thing. And so essentially, it&#8217;s a whole process of just talking to everyone and trying to figure out what stage they are at with the work and what I can help with, that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I think an indicator is&#8230; And I will share the link to the project board for editor task on 6.3, so we all can follow up on that and see how that is. Because that&#8217;s updated quite a bit between the editor triage team and the core leads tech teams. So core leads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Mainly what I&#8217;ve been doing on the board is adding in PRs for back ports to core. I see that there is a bunch of stuff in progress and needs to review columns in this board. I&#8217;m not 100% sure of the status of some of these. Some of these PRs definitely, I think, at this point it&#8217;s unlikely that they&#8217;ll make it in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the fact that it&#8217;s on the board doesn&#8217;t mean&#8230; And even if it&#8217;s marked in progress, it doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s actually going to make it because it can just be a PR that&#8217;s been sitting there for a while and it&#8217;s on our wishlist. We would love to do it. But if no one&#8217;s actually actively working on it at this point, then it&#8217;s unlikely to make it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I know that at the editor triage team, we are going through that as well and kind of figure out what comes in as issues from the testing parts of those. So to be sure the features that are in the Gutenberg releases 15.2 to 6.1, if they are not labeled as experimental, will make it into 6.3. So going back to the previous releases of Gutenberg, you can pretty much predict, &#8220;Okay, this is going to be in there.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What will be hard is to find out, &#8220;Well, you will be at 6.1, the release candidate will be next week.&#8221; And that kind of closes the feature freeze pretty much for 6.3, unless there&#8217;s something that is pushed through as a placed task by several core committers to say, &#8220;Yeah, that can make it and that will go in there.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Well, this was a long show today. Thank you so much for staying with me, Isabel, and providing so much great insights in the development and the design process as well as the release process. Is there anything that you want people to know about 6.3 or Gutenberg project that you are excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I think we&#8217;ve pretty much covered most of the things about the general processes. I&#8217;m pretty excited about the changes to the site editor and new improvements with browse mode. I hope everyone else is equally excited. I think this is going to be a pretty good release. Thanks for having me. It was a lot of fun chatting about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So if people want to get in touch with you, how can they find you? What would be a good place?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I am on GitHub as tellthemachines. I am on WordPress Slack as tellthemachines also. So ping me on Slack. I&#8217;m usually online during the week, Australia time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Well, thank you so much for being on the show. And I want to point out, we have a Gutenberg Times Live Q&amp;A coming up on July 6th at 17:00 UTC. And that&#8217;s about using Gutenberg scripts and components to revamp a plugin. It&#8217;s a case study and we are talking with the lead developer and the tech lead from GiveWP that have worked on their 3.0 revamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they have used most of the Gutenberg components or based it on WordPress components and scripts. And it opened quite new perspectives for them. So I am really excited to have Jason Adams, the director of development and Jon Waldstein, the lead developer of GiveWP on the show on July 6th, 17:00 UTC. I will share the link in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reserve your spot. And it&#8217;s a usual live Q&amp;A where we have some demos, and then we talk a little bit about the project and then we answer all the attendance questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 84. And if you have questions, suggestions or news you want us to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>.

Thank you, Isabel Brison. And I am so happy to have another show for you. That&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Bye-bye.

I also learned about new products, and new APIs. A huge thank you to the sponsors, organizers, speakers, volunteers, contributors, and attendees. It was a fabulous WordCamp, the biggest in the World. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Athens is a great big noisy and beautiful capital of Europe and the birthplace of philosophy and democracy.  I thoroughly enjoyed having a couple of days beyond the WordCamp to visit some sites and experience the antique and the contemporary of Greek art.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of art. My heart made a little jump when I saw the big boxes with Postcards from the <a href=\"https://block-museum.com/\"><strong>Museum of Block Art</strong></a>, at the Community Booth. They were part of the swap exchange game with WordPress trivia. WCEU Attendees received four cards of the same design in their swag bags, and could get the other designs by swapping them with other attendees. To get all eight designs, MCs would pose WordPress Trivia questions from the stage and attendees needed to come with the right answers to the community booth to get an additional post card design. I don&#8217;t know who many people actually appreciated the work of the artists or the work it took to get all the 2500 swag bags filled or how many people actually still write postcards. I found it a wonderful idea and took quite a few left over postcards with me. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>What else happened in the Gutenberg space? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours, 💕<br /><em>Birgit</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sortabrilliant-guidepost\"><ul><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#0-word-press-release-information\">Developing Gutenberg and WordPress</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#0-p\">Plugins, Themes, and Tools for #nocode site builders and owners</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#2-word-press-6-0-1-and-6-1-scheduled\">Theme Development for Full Site Editing and Blocks</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#3-building-themes-for-fse-and-word-press\">Building Blocks and Tools for the Block editor. </a></li></ul></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"0-word-press-release-information\">Developing Gutenberg and WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Did y&#8217;all see what the WordPress design team has been working on?

It allows you to combine blocks into a group wrapped with a hyperlink (&lt;a&gt;).

You can also transform an existing group block into a hyperlink block.

Furthermore, he will be sending some Gutenberg experts to join the sprint without any cost to the Drupal community.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Drupal Gutenberg module is used on more than 3,000 Drupal websites.

I bet on the Bees, who lost the game without even scoring. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I did not have the $10,000 I had bet. When I told the man I owed this, he was less than happy. He put a gun to my head and told me that if I did not have his cash in one week, he would put a bullet in my brain. I had the money three days later.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the crimes Bishop committed to cover that debt that got him sent to prison. Now an experienced professional, entrepreneur, and educator, who has spoken at numerous WordCamps, he credits WordPress for changing the trajectory of his life and helping him find a place of stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It saved my life,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;I am not being over-dramatic when I say that. If it was not for WordPress, I would either still be in prison or dead.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the time Bishop was incarcerated in Rockwell City, the Iowa Department of Corrections began allowing limited internet access to inmates, and he was fortunate enough to be in one of the select prisons. Writing a personal blog was one of the allowed activities, so Bishop went on the hunt for a blogging platform to use. He had already tried many of them, as he had been into open source software since the mid-90&#8217;s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As I was also fighting to overcome my gambling addiction, I had the idea of starting a blog about my experience as a sort of self-therapy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I tried TypePad first, but did not like it. Less than a month later, I discovered WordPress thanks to a correctional officer who had a blog of her own.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Wolf Bishop in prison in 2005, Rockwell City, IA\n\n\n\n<p>The officer had maintained a blog for the past several months and recommended to Bishop that WordPress would be the easiest and best for his needs. This was in the summer of 2005, just a few months after <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/\">WordPress 1.5</a> was released with a new &#8220;Pages&#8221; feature, a better templating system, and the Kubrick default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was at a point in my life when I knew that I needed to change, and drastically, or I was going to be in prison for the rest of my life, or worse….dead,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;I know that sounds over dramatic, but I swear it is true. I hoped that by blogging about my battle with addiction, I could better overcome it.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first blog launched in September 2005, and he posted weekly for just over one year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Prison is a place where hope is in low supply,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;You have to watch your back every minute of every day. Before WordPress, I got in a ton of trouble in prison. I spent a lot of time in the hole. I had nothing to focus my time or energy on, so I fought and walked around with a giant chip on my shoulder.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At one point he realized that he needed to change if he wanted to survive, get out of prison, and stay out of prison, but he was struggling with how to make this happen. Bishop attended Gamblers Anonymous (GA) but described himself as a somewhat shy person and found it difficult to open up to other people in the group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You cannot effect change until you open up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So when I found WordPress I was able to remain somewhat anonymous, and that made it easier to open up. I could write about my struggles and my feelings. I had some place safe to vent my fears and frustrations and anger. I had a safe space to process childhood trauma and self-destructive thought patterns.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2007, Bishop was released from prison and went into a work release program. These kinds of programs have employment requirements and have been shown to lower the recidivism rates among prisons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It was then that I discovered how difficult it is to overcome the stigma of being a felon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No matter how much I wanted to do better and succeed, it proved to be more challenging than I expected. Within three months I was sent back to prison for a parole violation after losing my minimum wage job.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bishop, who describes himself as &#8220;a pretty intense mix,&#8221; of being bi-polar and living with ADHD on the Autism spectrum, found it difficult in prison to manage the mental and emotional health issues that led him to a gambling addiction. Mental health resources for prisoners can be scarce, but blogging helped him find a way through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I guess you could just call it personal talk therapy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By writing about the experiences I had, being in prison, and how I was feeling, I was able to address my demons and work through the thought patterns that kept leading to destructive behaviors. I guess you could say it was more like a publicly accessible journal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Launching a WordPress Career Fresh Out of Prison</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What Bishop learned in the work release program in 2007 about the challenges inmates face after prison became even more clear when he was finally released in 2010. Even though he had fully completed his sentence and was not on supervision, the challenges remained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Every GOOD job I applied for shot me down the second they learned I was an ex-con,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;From 2010 until 2015, I struggled to get a job that would pay the bills. I worked dead end fast food and temp jobs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, he and his wife were homeless with three small children living in a tent in Texas. It was this year that he was given the opportunity that launched his career in WordPress. He was offered a support role at InMotion Hosting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They took a chance on me and they paid for us to move to Virginia Beach,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;At first, we still lived in a tent and then a hotel. From there it was an upward trajectory and my career has continued to grow.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img />Wolf Bishop speaking at WordCamp Atlanta in 2018\n\n\n\n<p>In the years following, Bishop has worked in various support roles and branched out into launching his own development and hosting companies. He is now on his fourth WordPress business, <a href=\"https://wpoctane.co/\">WP Octane</a>, which follows two that failed and two that he successfully built and sold. WP Octane started in 2016 under the name WP Top Hat, and was geared towards being a 1-stop WordPress shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The idea was to have a company that provided everything a business needed for its online presence,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;But trying to provide managed hosting, ongoing care, content management, marketing, SEO, and several other services proved to be more than I could handle on my on.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, just before the pandemic hit, he decided to convert to just a managed WordPress host with ongoing care plans included, and changed the name to WP Octane. For the next two years his small startup struggled to thrive during the pandemic, although he did see some growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Finally, in early 2022, WP Octane became profitable for the very first time,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;Since then we have continued to grow, albeit slowly.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In late 2022, after investing more into infrastructure, WP Octane pivoted again to offer low cost shared WordPress hosting that serves a middle of the road between shared and managed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We limit tenancy of all servers to a fraction of what most shared hosts have,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;We introduced features that allow us to outperform most shared hosts and come pretty close to matching performance of a managed WordPress host. We have virtually eliminated many of the typical pitfalls of shared hosting like the dreaded noisy neighbor syndrome.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Octane still offers fully managed plans with ongoing care included as they did previously, but the new shared platform has taken off better than Bishop expected and is now the company&#8217;s primary focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Empowering Inmates and Ex-Convicts for Success with WordPress Skills</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bishop is also now invested in giving back through a new effort to launch a prison program that will teach inmates the skills they need to use WordPress. The program is still in its early stages and has gotten preliminary approval from the Missouri Department of Corrections, which is local to where he now lives on 63 acres in the Ozarks. He is working on completing the curriculum, a requirement before it can be fully approved. The target for that phase is early August so it can go to a committee for approval at a September meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is this struggle that led me to start this project,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to give inmates that truly want to turn their lives around a skill that can enable them to do just that. If they learn how to work with WordPress, whether it be design, development, SEO, or any other area, they can avoid some of the challenges I faced.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bishop said inmates equipped with WordPress skills will not be at the mercy of employers who are unwilling to give them a chance, because they have a skill they can use independently. If they go the route of custom development, most clients do not ask for a background check.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When participants complete the program and eventually get out of prison, they will have a portfolio that they can show to potential clients and even employers,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;It is my hope that it will increase their chances of success.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a first of its kind program that is still awaiting final approval. In the beginning he is aiming to launch it in the Missouri prison system but said he would love to take it nationwide some day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bishop is also working on a related project &#8211; a website that lists employment opportunities with WordPress companies that are willing to give ex-offenders a chance. The project is still in the early planning stages as he talks with employers to encourage them to join this movement. His experience with this community has led him to believe that WordPress will be a beacon of hope and opportunity for anyone who wants to make something on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WordPress helped me overcome addiction,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;It taught me the value of community and that if you are willing to put in the work, you do not have to rely on others to &#8216;let&#8217; you succeed. WordPress lets you make success a choice.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Jun 2023 15:58:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:134:\"Post Status: Sustainability Team • Supporting Organizations • Commercial &amp; Community Themes &amp; Plugins • Pattern Curation\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=149632\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:121:\"https://poststatus.com/sustainability-team-supporting-organizations-commercial-community-themes-plugins-pattern-curation/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17742:\"<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-april-3-2023\">This Week at WordPress.org (June 12, 2023)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">The WordPress Sustainability Team has launched.

In this episode, they discuss designing pricing plans and creating a compelling website homepage for their new product. They delve into the intricacies of annual and lifetime subscription options and the inclusion of site licenses for different customer segments. They also explore the balance between providing value and maintaining profitability. Throughout the conversation, they brainstorm ideas, share case studies, and weigh the pros and cons of various pricing strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consider customer preferences</strong>. It is critical to understand customer preferences and needs when determining pricing plans. Exploring options, such as lifetime licenses and differentiating plans based on the number of sites, can help you strike a balance between value and affordability for customers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seek feedback</strong>. Recognize the value of seeking feedback from others in relevant communities. Reach out for input and opinions. External perspectives can provide valuable insights and help refine your approach.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus on website messaging and design</strong>. Acknowledge the importance of presenting information in a coherent and engaging manner. Consider using design elements to enhance a website&#8217;s overall visual appeal and user experience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://crop.express/\">Crop.Express</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\">Easy Digital Downloads</a> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://ithemes.com/backupbuddy/?=matchtype=b&keyword=backup%20buddy%20plugin&cid=14487028719&agid=132326792291&device=c&placement=&creative=629501906087&target=&adposition=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=backup%20buddy%20plugin&utm_content=629501906087&utm_campaign=search+-+na+-+backup+-+buddy&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw-IWkBhBTEiwA2exyOyk30qMKQEhBpuZK9jf3naRBMo4QTSmwsJyLWPePozHgvkpdOO3tOBoCOroQAvD_BwE\">BackupBuddy</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-you-can-follow-post-status-and-our-guests-on-twitter\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f426.png\" alt=\"🐦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-wrapper\">\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/coreymaass\">Corey Maass</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> (CEO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\">Olivia Bisset</a> (Intern, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper has-background\">The <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4dd.png\" alt=\"📝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Browse our archives</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe via <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simplecast</a>, or <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Session 17 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>C&amp;C 17</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Webinar. Webinar is live. We&#8217;re live session Summit. Corey and Corey launching a product. Okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:11] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So we all go up together. Yeah. You&#8217;re probably already standing, aren&#8217;t you? I am. Although you&#8217;re leaning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:19] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I&#8217;m leaning, standing, standing. Okay. Yep. We were, uh, just talking through a logo. We&#8217;ve had some revisions with the designer, and so Corey was sharing some of the thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think this is part of that journey is like, something&#8217;s always in the way, you know, that you gotta Yeah,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:38] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> exactly. Like, so yeah, I, you know, so the plugin is coming along really well. Um, but to do, uh, you know, to, to feel like you&#8217;re really moving forward, Uh, for branding and marketing, which we&#8217;ve talked about a bit in the last couple of weeks, we, we need the logo, which defines the colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the good news is we can, we can take the colors that we&#8217;ve got from the logo, um, and you know, and we can, and we can start moving forward with some things. But it&#8217;s, um, we approved the horizontal. So if you&#8217;re looking at my screen, um, I, what I think they&#8217;ve done. Which is fine. Uh, um. Is they took the, originally, I thought it was a white bar over, um, I think it&#8217;s Montserrat is the final font, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I think what they&#8217;ve actually done is, is split it in half, which is fine because that that leaves No, my, my previous issue was there were like little triangles. Based on where they cut it. Um, and so the, the horizontal looks good now, but when you go over to the vertical, what they should have done is, is take the revision of the I M G from the [00:02:00] horizontal and applied it to the vertical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think they took us at our word that they, that we were like, you know, and the vertical&#8217;s. Okay. So they were just like, here it is, even though it&#8217;s inconsistent. So, One more revision. Um, and uh, and I, I mean, what&#8217;s great is, is they are giving us the e p s. You can see I&#8217;ve got Illustrator open in the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so I can mess around with it cuz I&#8217;m still not totally sold on. The, the vertical version, which is not their fault. Like they&#8217;ve done what we&#8217;ve said. Um, I, so I think we wanna go back to them and say, Hey, you know, please update the vertical, the i m g on the vertical based on the changes that you made to the I M G in the horizontal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:54] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> really what you mean there is, is not just colors, but is it the bar where the bar is?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:58] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The colors of the vertical are fine. Because we, we sort of defined that based on the website we sent them. Um, but you know, I guess it would be, yeah, it would be nice since it would be nice if they finished what they were doing kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then I think at some point you and I like, I think we go forward with this and this is part of us talking about, uh, you know, and, whoops, did I lose my microphone? There we go. Um, You know, part of the journey is, um, just pun just, just moving forward, you know? And so it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t. If they fix the bar, I&#8217;m content with putting this online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not totally sold that, that this is actually the best vertical version, but at some point, you know, it, it&#8217;ll occur to us like, oh, the black should be the bottom third of each, or whatever. And. And I&#8217;ll go into, you know, either, we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll use them again and say, okay, we need another revision, or I&#8217;ll go in and make the change, but good enough for now or go once they make the change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s at least consistent then good enough. And I was half joking that the, the real reason I&#8217;m in such a hurry is that, um, sticker Mule runs specials every week and so their coupons run out and inevitably that&#8217;s, um, so how, that&#8217;s how we end up with like 10 of the crop express coupon, the stickers that we don&#8217;t actually need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:42] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Nostalgia. Um, hey, so. Here, here&#8217;s my question. What, what are the things that you want changed here? Like, one thing that stick out, obviously the bar you want it moved up toward the top. Omg.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:58] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> No, I, all I want is, um, for them, I think I&#8217;ve even got it open, so I just want them to take the, the img. Oh. From here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And, and put it where it&#8217;s supposed to, you know, replace what, what they had. So really, there&#8217;s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:19] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> two bars on the vertical version?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:22] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Uh, I think there&#8217;s, I mean, so it&#8217;s like, oh, okay. Yeah. See how there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s that little carrot taken out right. Of, of the m. But on here, we had asked them to remove it, so there is none.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So it&#8217;s like if they just update the i, the m and the G of the vertical version using the, the revised i m g of the horizontal, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re done. Okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:59] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So it, it occurs to me though, when you&#8217;re looking at this, the, the OMG fills letter spacing this wider mm-hmm. In the vertical than it is the horizontal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s maybe one of the things I was thinking of, like, can you copy and paste the horizontal into a new, so we can look at it real quick or just pull that IMG down or something so we can look at it. Yep. You see that letter space in here looks way tighter,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:24] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> which it will be because they&#8217;re putting the I under the O.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the O is so much wider.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:32] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> It still looks, but look at this space between the O and the M. It just feels loose. Mm-hmm. Yep. Here, I&#8217;ll show you. I&#8217;ll try it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:45] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. Um,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:49] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> like it, can you take the IMG right there and put and pull it underneath just to see how Yep, yep,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:55] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Showing off my. Amazing skills here, but yeah, if we matched Okay. The M and the G Well,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:15] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> hey, go up. Yeah, yeah, right there. Hold on just a second. Let&#8217;s look at that for a second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know the, the vertical version that they&#8217;ve got just feels. And&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:29] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> get it. Oh, I see. Yeah. The white space is so much more between all of the letters. Yeah. It&#8217;s just, just which I, which I suspect they did because they&#8217;re trying to match. It&#8217;s like if, if these are here, then, then it&#8217;s more pronounced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Between the I and the M, like there&#8217;s no good answer for that right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That looks&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:01] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> better though to me. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:05] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So yeah, have &#8217;em have &#8217;em do a version where they&#8217;re like, literally put the i m G below the the OMG and center the eye and call it done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:18] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Can you move the eye over just so we can see? Yeah. See how it looks. For a second.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:25] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Maybe I just did it. Huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t hate it. Right. It&#8217;s, yeah. It might be, it might be enough to go live with, and again, at some point it, it&#8217;ll occur to us what&#8217;s wrong with it or how to fix it. Yeah. Or, you know, we will have totally changed our branding by then or something. Okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:52] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Hold on a second. Let me screenshot that. Okay. I mean, do you like the two bars on the vertical?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:02] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I&#8217;m conflicted because when you get small it becomes unreadable. Right? And that&#8217;s honestly how most, most people are gonna see it. Most of the time. Like in, in the plug-in repo, you know, it, you can, you do okay. Where it&#8217;s there, but it&#8217;s like not contrasty enough. But like in most places it&#8217;s gonna end up small, small, and it just, you can&#8217;t read it at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m kind of, of the mind, like I said now of. Good enough, like this lets us go live and we can, we can change it. Okay. You know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds good. Um, so cool. That&#8217;s that. So honestly, like I will just, I will stop mucking about with the one they sent. Um, and why don&#8217;t we just use this for now? Yeah. And essentially live with it, you know, but in, in the wild for a while and see how we feel about it. Okay. Um, cool. So that&#8217;s the logo. And then, um, a while ago on AppSumo, I signed up for a lifetime deal of ui, which lets you run te essentially like repeat, click, click, click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, um, I&#8217;ve been setting up testing cuz I&#8217;m sort of in the weeds with where I think everything&#8217;s working. But this way it at least clicks through and, um, makes sure that we have all the basic features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, um, Once that&#8217;s done, like I think we&#8217;re, I think the plugin version one is, is ready to go. Um, and so honestly, unless you have something else, what I was thinking was we might, like, while we&#8217;re sitting here for the next hour, 45 minutes, we&#8217;ve got, um, let&#8217;s take the wording that we came up with last week and just do a quick bang through of the homepage and plug it in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing like building, building a website live. Is this you ui&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:51] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> or something different?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:53] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Uh, so this is our current homepage, omg img.co. Okay. And, uh, on the left and then on the right. Is the words we came up with last time. Okay, cool. So, uh, in builder. So let&#8217;s see. What&#8217;s cool is we do now have, um, did I close it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How I minimize it, file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do now have colors</p>\n\n\n\n<p>again. I do not know Illustrator very well. One of the things that I always like to do on all of my websites is create a page called Assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here we say Diviv. Oops. Style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How was breakfast, by the way? Good. Good to see&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> my grandfather, he&#8217;s 93 years old. Wow. Yeah. Good for him. He&#8217;s the OG entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He sold his business about three, four months after I sold mine, but he had his longer. I told him, I said I might&#8217;ve beat him to that, but he beat me in longevity. He had a motorcycle dealership for 40&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:42] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> years. Wow. What kind of motorcycles? Honda in Yamaha.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:48] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t remember if we talked about this. You&#8217;ve rid, you had a motorcycle that you showed me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:58] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Four-wheeler. Uh, I&#8217;m trying to have a motorcycle. Um, I, yeah, I owned it for about an hour and then, uh, it stopped running, which I knew was always going to be an issue cuz it&#8217;s, uh, 1982 something. But I hoped I could work on it, but in the end I couldn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and the. The shop that it went to has now had it for a year, and I keep stopping by and I&#8217;m like bringing them donuts and stuff cuz I&#8217;m like, how do we move this forward? But so far, no, no joy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:45] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> using Uber Builder and doing an assets page. That&#8217;s cool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:50] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, so this is what I do for, um, all of my sites, um, is like once I&#8217;ve got a color palette, um, usually I&#8217;m using, uh, colors, col, col coolers or whatever. Um, Look at that rainbow. That&#8217;s fantastic. I love those colors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:14] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So you create this within Beaver Builder to kind of reference within the website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:19] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. Like, uh, I&#8217;ll come in and I&#8217;ll drop in the logos. So it&#8217;s like, cuz inevitably, you know, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re making changes live somewhere or. You know, you&#8217;re updating your Twitter account profile or your, you know, somebody&#8217;s like, oh, I, hey, could you send me a logo? You know, I&#8217;m interviewing you on a podcast and you send me a logo and you&#8217;re like, let me go look through a thousand folders to try to find that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you can just say, go to slash assets. Um, just kind of a, a habit I got into a while ago. Um, And then it also helps with like defining, you know, doing this kind of thing where it&#8217;s like, once you define, have your colors defined once you can save them, stuff like that. So anyway, um, so we&#8217;ll plug into logo later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so words on the right, what&#8217;s, what&#8217;s the first one we want to go with? Like what I figure is this on the left will be a product shot. Sure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:27] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Let me find, uh, that doc you&#8217;re looking at. Website. Got it. Okay. Okay, cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about professional? Social images for your website in content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:10] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> For your WordPress website. I always like to put in WordPress right up front so that people aren&#8217;t like, sure, I&#8217;m on Wick. Why can&#8217;t I use this? Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it&#8217;s not. They have Montserrat. Whoops. Yep, I do. There it&#8217;s so wheat,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>extra bowl, ultra bowl.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:41] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Boom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:52] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Bigger. I want bigger,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and we can mess with this kind of stuff later, but if we get it to find so professional social images for your WordPress website and content. Okay. What if that&#8217;s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:14] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> what, if that&#8217;s the subhead and because see, we got in here because your image matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if we make that the headline and then professional social, you know, create mm-hmm. Professional social images for your workforce website and content so that, like the headline is because your l your image matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:47] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So like swap the use basically? Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:49] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. Because your image matters. I like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:02] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I want the, cuz you&#8217;re, Because your images matter feels like better English. But&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:13] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> overall, you know, I think it&#8217;s cuz your image mattered. Like, and that&#8217;s all of these things helps you with your, like, it&#8217;s more abstract than social images, you know,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:25] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> because your Oh, nice. Got it. Yeah. And the pun about. How people perceive you, your image and Oh, brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love it. Totally missed that. Um,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:39] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> and then for this, how about, it&#8217;s like an action ver that says transformer create professional social images for your WordPress website and content. Love it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:05] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> And then of course a big button, not a button group. Not a button, which is right there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buy it today. Purchase it. I never know what to do in these buttons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:24] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>buy, shoot. What&#8217;s the normal thing? Get started by, uh, pricing. Um, yeah, buy today works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, could you put image on the second line?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Cool. Okay, so we got top, top header. I think that that, that&#8217;s a good start. Yep. Okay. Then we talked about, uh, benefits or on our web doc here we have the before and after.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:27] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Mm-hmm. So if we did, yeah. So, uh, what, to me, what&#8217;s funny here would be. An image is worth a thousand words. The obvious. Yeah. Worth a thousand words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then here we have</p>\n\n\n\n<p>like, obviously I have to create these, but a before and after. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:01] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, oh, I like that. So I like that because the image could have the before and the after, and then underneath we could have, you know, this list we talked about, like boring afterthought, stale homo placeholder, and then after a sparkle and ties hook, engaged in, compelling, something like that if we wanted to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. I kinda though it&#8217;s like right, right at top, almost before above the fold. We have a really good explanation&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:28] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so if like, we don&#8217;t need to repeat repo before and after, but, so I really like the idea of, um, so basically we, we use our own words to say,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one to make it clear what&#8217;s going on here before and after. But then you&#8217;d say boring.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:07] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, oh yeah, boring still. Afterthoughts, homogenized, placeholder,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:17] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right? And so it&#8217;s like,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So something like that. So it&#8217;s like before, before, after. Okay. Here&#8217;s an, here&#8217;s a simple example. Here&#8217;s an, here&#8217;s another example of, you know, the landscape and then the enticing. So it&#8217;s like, you know, we&#8217;re repeating without having to repeat. Before, after, before, after, before, after. Over and over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s cool. That&#8217;s a good idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snail boring and I really like placeholder. And we could do something like, you know, from placeholder. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:01] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> From, oh, I like that. From boring to enticing, from placeholder to engaging or whatever that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:23] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know my text is wrong, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p>oops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, what&#8217;s the right arrow</p>\n\n\n\n<p>or after from boring to engaging from placeholder. Oh, we already did. Engaging,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>oh, bo from boring to enticing from placeholder to engaging something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please hold her. So there, there, I feel like we&#8217;ll want a, a noun. Yeah. I&#8217;m boring to engaging. I like better. And then from placeholder to quite well presentable, placeholder to powerful, placeholder to hummus. I don&#8217;t know. Um,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:48] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I like that. We&#8217;ll wanna nail the photos, but that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the product. Um, yeah, I think that&#8217;s great, man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. We&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:55] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> can do, hold on. Lemme get the right green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Row settings</p>\n\n\n\n<p>safe. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then</p>\n\n\n\n<p>benefits. Benefits. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No more boring afterthought, stale&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:32] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> images. I wonder if we say stale. No more stale images since we use Born and Afterthought Above. Mm-hmm. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>entice people to click. See. How many sections&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:52] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> do we have? Three. Okay. Well, uh, you know, we can have as many as we want. It was just, okay,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:01] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> so I think, let&#8217;s see. No more still images entice. Do we use entice about entice people to click more value in your images? Uh, I think if we did three, it&#8217;d be no more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stella Images entice people to click Stay in your WordPress workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:35] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Nice people to click with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Valuable content right inside your image or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then what was the last one? Stay&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:53] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> in your WP Workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:11] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> No more jumping from app to app. Yep. To make your images&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:23] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> shine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. And then, so did you just load a standard Beaver builder page, or do you, is this a template you use for stuff?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:42] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I just, we, there was one of the websites we were looking at that was just like, there are these rows, and so I just banged out some rows. Awesome. So this is, you know, I have, I have no religion about this page whatsoever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can, yeah. I was just kidding. Massage this any number of ways.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:02] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So I think that section is benefits. Then we get down to brass tacks of like features. Okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:12] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So, yeah, let&#8217;s for the sake of, I never want to actually like, say benefits, but for the sake of our knocking this out, this is benefits, this is features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:43] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I always like seeing how other people do this stuff cuz.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:48] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Well, exactly. That was part of why I figured we&#8217;d do it live. Cuz it&#8217;s like, cool, let&#8217;s, you know, somebody else can, who has never seen Beaver Builder can check it out and or you know, has never knocked together. So I, and I love what we did. Like normally I&#8217;d be sitting here staring at text boxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Whereas you and I did the words in a Word doc, which is so much smarter, but I&#8217;m usually too impatient to do that. Yeah. So, um, So I have a feeling that we can,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>actually, why don&#8217;t I just do this,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>rose</p>\n\n\n\n<p>benefits, we&#8217;ll say duplicate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost one click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Post product</p>\n\n\n\n<p>or podcast info, right? Add info, right. Into your</p>\n\n\n\n<p>featured image, um, keyword stuffing, and I don&#8217;t know that it actually reads as English, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p>featured image, so people want to click more something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, beautiful, versatile templates, shoes from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whoops. I got it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customization,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>um, your. And colors</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and fonts or&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:10] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> consistent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:17] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Keep going. Keep going. We got two more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:21] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Let&#8217;s see. Um, each pose, beautiful templates, customization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you can download images. Hmm. Uh, create images by social channel&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:44] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> customization, um, or channel, uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:57] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Middle size,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:00] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> uh oh. Right. Um, create once, use everywhere. Um, create an image and then resize it for, um, open graph.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn. What&#8217;s the only fans? Um, what&#8217;s the, the ultra white. Ultra Ultra White. Ultra right? Conservative. We should, we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll just keyword stuff. All of these, you know. Um, Open graph, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Any other channel you yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:59] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Need capitalize that T real quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Thank you. Yep. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, this might be a nuance, but is op open graph not two words?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:09] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> That is a great question. Facebook open. Yeah. Open graph. Two words.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:21] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. So we need to change that up at the top too. Yeah. Or somewhere we did it somewhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe that was it. I thought there was something above. But</p>\n\n\n\n<p>you gonna write a note on our thing? Like we needed a, what is open graph? Hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>you know, all the social software do these, what sizes are what, but it&#8217;s still good content that people want to reference even though we&#8217;ve got it baked in. Yeah. So, Some sort images by</p>\n\n\n\n<p>at the bottom of this document.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we got six. Mm-hmm. I think that&#8217;s a good start. I&#8217;m trying to think if we&#8217;ve missed anything. I mean, you can save &#8217;em as projects. That&#8217;s one. I mean, really it&#8217;s a social image generator regardless of the content I. Create images in there. So it&#8217;s a social image generator. But, um, just talking out. Thanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure I didn&#8217;t miss anything. We already have size. Do we have sizing somewhere? No, no. I dot Maybe that&#8217;s not a customization. Customizing and resize. No, I don&#8217;t know. See,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:28] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right. The resizing we&#8217;ve got. Create once. Use everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So open graph images for your site, open graph images for each post page, et cetera. Oh, each post</p>\n\n\n\n<p>or page. Beautiful, versatile templates. Use our bespoke templates to match your branding or upload your own customization. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>tweak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:36] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Make sure and save. What&#8217;s that? Make sure and save. Yeah. Is it auto save or do you need to save&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:45] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> it every now and then? Um, I think it sort of does, but we can publish as we go cuz it can&#8217;t be any worse than the placeholder We already have Command&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:52] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> s Man, that&#8217;s my, uh, mantra.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:57] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Command s Yeah. Yeah. I really, that&#8217;s sorry about the dog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah, I like, I&#8217;ve gotten used to like the, Um, code editor. I used Auto Saves and like here in ui, like it just saves as you go, which I&#8217;m always grateful&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:15] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> for. It&#8217;s funny, the old days, you know, you had to command s everything and I still want to do it even box. Yep. So next session section is plans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:29] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So yeah, we, we will want testimonials, but we don&#8217;t have any yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:39] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> mean, in Lugo testimonials, we can say, see it in action, you know? Hmm. With the post status stuff,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:50] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> we call that a, um, what do they call it? A case study. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A studies. So how do we want to present this, I guess is the. The question, the case study? Yeah, I, I guess just like a picture. I don&#8217;t know,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:40] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I think we pushed this maybe down below, um, plans for now, but that&#8217;s just a first reaction. Um, yeah, I see it in action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:58] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> It&#8217;s okay. So yeah, if here we had,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>so down here we said see it in action, see it in action. And then here we have plans. So plans on the homepage? I think so. Okay. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>so we&#8217;re not doing free, right? Um, so currently I think we&#8217;re talking about annual Yeah. And lifetime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:58] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> think a lifetime with the cab, you know, the caveats we discussed, which is sport for one year. But, uh, you know, lifetime upgrades I think is a good starter thing that we know will probably go away. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um, so we could have an, we could have annual B two thing, well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>one site. Lots of, oh. Um,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:31] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> do we want to do it that way? Yeah. E D D C E. Um, easy digital download supports. So annual and lifetime, and then also number of sites. And I tend to be a big baby about it because, uh, I always just am happier as a customer when it&#8217;s unlimited sites. But I think we can, there&#8217;s.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:07] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> No, I get you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if we did, um, like the solo, you know, they just have one site. Mm-hmm. And then we did the kind of freelancer agency bundle, and that&#8217;s how we kind of differentiated. So like one site is like, I just want the one. Yep. Uh, and then, um, for that avatar, and then for the agencies, we just say like, it&#8217;s the bundle, the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Annual unlimited or the lifetime thing? That could be okay. That could be our three plans. I&#8217;m just talking this out with you&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:45] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> though. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Um, so we&#8217;re talking about solo one site. Yeah. Basically&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:56] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> the</p>\n\n\n\n<p>main, you know, It&#8217;s funny. So let me give you a quick case study. So backup buddy for instance, it they form that form, that product formulated all their pricing plans and mm-hmm. Uh, definitely you see that within the industry, but it was our first big one back in 2010. And so, but our thesis was meant for a backup plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need a two side plugin. What if your side goes down? You need another one. So we started, we, we sold two side plans. Now, That, that sounds very like reasonable, right? People would say, every now and then, do you just have a one side version? You&#8217;re like, are you</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it? It&#8217;s almost like this. It&#8217;s this funny thing within product stuff. It&#8217;s like, why am I paying for more than I need? And you&#8217;re like, okay. So I tend to think there&#8217;s some terminology we put around here. It&#8217;s just like you have a website, a blog, whatever that is. Maybe it&#8217;s the content creator package, um, and web, we just need one, but that needs to be probably higher because why wouldn&#8217;t you just go ahead and get, um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and then I think the,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>hold on just a second. And then, yeah, agency plan and lifetime Limited, limited&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:32] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> lifetime. So how many sites? So it&#8217;s like, yeah. Okay. Yeah, if you want. So it&#8217;s um, we&#8217;re just mocking this up here. Do, do text editor. So it&#8217;s like website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One site license. Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agency</p>\n\n\n\n<p>what? 10, 20. I mean, this is an arbitrary number. Yeah. Let&#8217;s start with 10. So 10 site licenses. Yep. Annual subscription. Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then</p>\n\n\n\n<p>way get out of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then limited lifetime. This is</p>\n\n\n\n<p>100. Site licenses. Yeah, there you go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:55] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> There you go. Because it&#8217;s not really unlimited for everything. [00:49:00] Yeah. Let&#8217;s see. That, uh, we use on purchase up time. Updates only support one year. Support&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:09] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> one year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:10] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So many people paying this, but I go, no, it&#8217;s not unlimited Everything. Right. Support is what it costs us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re gonna be doing updates for this for foreseeable future. So like that&#8217;s already built in. But support is extra now. People still don&#8217;t read, don&#8217;t think about it. They put it off, don&#8217;t. But I, I think, you know, we, we do a one to three month type thing. Seat, our initial customer list. Mm-hmm. Use them for feedback, bugs, stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New ideas. And then we just take that down. That&#8217;ll give us some&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:44] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> cash too. Oh, whoops. I&#8217;m doing these backwards. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one site license.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Annual subscription agency, 10 site licenses, annual subscription, limited lifetime, and hundred site licenses. One time purchase updates forever. And this is, this is where most agencies will probably jump anyway, right? Cuz it&#8217;s like, just buy it, you know, if it&#8217;s, uh, I think we&#8217;d talked about like 50 bucks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, 300 bucks, 500 bucks, whatever it is. Yeah. They&#8217;ll just go, you know what, it&#8217;s 500 bucks and we never have to think about it again. Of course we&#8217;re gonna do it. Yeah. Hey&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:50:39] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Corey, I&#8217;m sorry for being late today. I need to spin down about five minutes, but here&#8217;s my, here&#8217;s my thought on this. Let&#8217;s think, let&#8217;s anchor ourselves for a moment in lifetime and, uh, the lifetime price and let&#8217;s go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. It&#8217;s unlimited. We&#8217;re gonna for the goal of one, to get cash and also to seed our customer base for features, all that kind of stuff. Um, and then I think we go down, down this box to the left. Mm-hmm. And like, really, I think for this initial thing, we want people in lifetime cause we wanna see that group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, maybe it&#8217;s the first a hundred people and then kind of close off, but. I think that could help us price the agency and website stuff because honestly, we&#8217;ll want that higher to push &#8217;em up to lifetime, um, for the beginning in, in my mind. Um, so how does, how does that sound like as far as what, what, what, if we go with that for a second, what price will we want to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlimited or lifetime unlimited bundle. So the&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:51:49] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> rule of thumb that I go by for lifetime is three years. And, uh, and then here we&#8217;re introducing number of sites. So it&#8217;s how much, how much value per site times three years. And like we are, we&#8217;re saying, you know, a hundred sites, but realistically, you know, it&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kind of like you say, three years. Most people subscribe between two and 300 site licenses. May as well be unlimited, unless you are some bananas agency or you&#8217;re cranking out, um, just click bait websites. But so it&#8217;s like 20 sites times three years. Yeah, something like that. And so if it&#8217;s. Because it&#8217;s a big fat discount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were at $30 times, 20 sites times three years, you&#8217;re talking about 1800 bucks, which I just can&#8217;t, like that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the value. But for a new product, I think people are gonna be like, the hell are you thinking?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I, I guess I, I hear your, uh, your thought process to me. 1, 1 1 website currently, because it&#8217;s a new product, $50 feels about right. And so then it&#8217;s, so let if, if one website, if this is $50, then agency is $40 per site times 10 sites, and then Lifetime knocks it down to $30 per site. But obviously we can&#8217;t multiply it by 99 or by a hundred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But do you know what I mean? Like Yeah. To me that&#8217;s the discount. You&#8217;d kind of, you know, buy in bulk discount. The way we&#8217;re thinking about this. So it&#8217;s like, if this was,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>you gotta go. So this might, you know, maybe we leave this as a thought experiment. Yeah. Um, if that&#8217;s 49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and then that&#8217;s,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have no idea. Because it&#8217;s like 40 times. I mean, for 150% you get 10, 10 x the value,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and you&#8217;re making&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:54:46] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> easy, easy math for &#8217;em.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:54:49] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> That&#8217;s kind of what I&#8217;m, yep. So backwards 1 49.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stick. It&#8217;s doing something weird.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So something like that. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:55:21] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Let&#8217;s simmer on this. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:55:31] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So yeah, we&#8217;ve got, right now we&#8217;ve at least got benefits and features on the homepage, stubbed out, and then pricing. We can, people watching, listening, please weigh in. We don&#8217;t have the biggest viewership in the world, but anybody who who does have an opinion on this would be great. Um, and it would actually, so maybe we.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, post this in post status business and I might post this also in MegaMaker and just say, what do people think about this? I think it would be neat. Um, we might or might not listen to anybody, but it would be interesting to get people&#8217;s thinking about it. I agree. Um, and, um, Disclaimer, we should have said this before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody is allowed to hold us to what they just saw, um, or any of these conversations. Um,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:56:25] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> but okay. Well, today, to summarize what we&#8217;ve talked about, I&#8217;m trying to do this more so it&#8217;s on the recording. Um, we&#8217;ve talked about logo. We worked on website homepage, features and benefits, pricing. Um, and now we got some next steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are those?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:56:51] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So thinking about this stuff, um, tweaking these 10 sites, annual</p>\n\n\n\n<p>100 sites, lifetime. What do you say? One year? One year of support? Yeah. Lifetime updates. Um, okay. So yeah, I think we think about, we think about pricing, um, have some conversations with people about that. Think about the words that we&#8217;ve put on this website, and if there isn&#8217;t a way to. Massage them so that they&#8217;re a bit more coherent, less brain dump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, and then also I think I may, I may take a pass of, um, we&#8217;ve bookmarked a few sites that we like a design of, so I try to actually bring some design to this so that it&#8217;s not just stripes of color. Sounds good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:57:54] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Cool. All right, man. Good progress. Thank you. Yeah. Good work today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:58:01] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Chat soon.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how to keep your WordPress website secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head over to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Robert Abela. Robert is the CEO and founder of Melapress, formerly known as WP White Security. They make niche WordPress security and admin plugins. He has over 18 years of experience in the IT and software industries and has written numerous web security articles and white papers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that your website is potentially under attack 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. But why is that? And what can we do to mitigate that risk?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert talks about the security of WordPress Core and how it&#8217;s matured over the years. He feels that in most cases, it&#8217;s not the Core of WordPress that you need to be concerned about, rather the array of plugins and themes which are added on top. The unique cocktail of software that you add to your site makes it challenging for security products to secure it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, Robert is optimistic that there are strategies you can adopt which will make your site less likely to fall prey to malicious actors or bots. Updating plugins on a regular basis, keeping fresh backups and the monitoring of logs, all play a vital role and a straightforward to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert is also at pains to point out that this is not a one-click or one time fix. You&#8217;re going to need to dedicate time and resources to your website security, and those resources and time will need to be increased as the importance and reach of your website grows. Evolution is the key here. What worked yesterday might not work so effectively tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another topic we touch on is the automated nature of many of these attacks. Unless you&#8217;re hosting a website of some importance, hackers are not trying to break your specific website. They&#8217;re deploying automated attacks, trying to infect many websites at the same time. But why do they do this? What are the motivations of these bad actors? Robert explains that it&#8217;s not personal, but that does not mean that you can ignore the threat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also chat about the many layers which go into making your website work. Typically, you&#8217;ve got a web server, a database, and often much more, and Robert explains why you need to be mindful of all of these when drawing up your security posture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, of course there&#8217;s the users of your site. The people who you&#8217;ve allowed to have legitimate access to the WordPress admin. If you&#8217;re in a large company with a high churn of employees, you&#8217;ll need to make sure that only people who need access have access, and that the permissions that they&#8217;re afforded a correct for the work they need to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how you can secure your WordPress website as it grows this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WP tavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Robert Abela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Robert Abela. Hello, Robert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:31] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> Hello, Nathan. Thank you very much for the invitation. Always nice to talk to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Really nice to talk to you. I&#8217;ve spoken to you on various other occasions, so I know who you are, but it occurs to me that perhaps the audience don&#8217;t. Would you mind just spending a moment giving us a little potted history of yourself? Your relationship with WordPress. We&#8217;re going to be talking about security today, so perhaps that would be a good thing to concentrate on as well. So, Robert, over to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:55] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> Sure, I started when I was 20. I started working for a security software company. And through the process of 10, 12 years, I worked through different number of software security companies. So I was working in security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for the last company I was working for, we needed a blog. And back then WordPress was up and coming basically. So yeah, we started using WordPress. Back then was the only viable, very good solution to use. But still, it was in its early days. It was around 2012, 2011, 2012. So of course back then security was a big issue, and there weren&#8217;t the vendors that there are today and the solutions that there are today. It definitely got my interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while I was working with the company, of course we implemented WordPress, but it got my interest. And then I met some people who worked in WordPress. You know, I like the idea of working from home or doing something for yourself. So yeah, it started as a hobby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started writing about WordPress security and reading a bit more, because I was using it for my full-time job. Slowly, slowly it turned into a part-time, from a hobby into a part-timer. And then, yeah, it developed into full-time. And now yeah, I run a company, it&#8217;s called WP White Security, which currently by the way, we are re branding to Melapress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yeah, we develop a number of security and management plugins. We started mostly with security plugins. But slowly, slowly we&#8217;re developing also a number of plugins, which kind of like, a mix of both. Security and also user slash website management plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. People who are listening to this podcast, we have a real wide range of an audience. The audience is really broad and deep. And the reason I mention that is because there&#8217;ll be a cohort of that audience who understand all the ins and outs of security. And there&#8217;ll be a whole load of other people who realize that security online is a thing, but don&#8217;t really have any understanding of what we&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So perhaps that would be a good place to lay the groundwork on. Tell us a little bit about the state of WordPress security, if you like. We often hear about a plugin being a fix, or a firewall being a fix, or maybe you sign up for some kind of SaaS app and that&#8217;s the fix. But I&#8217;m sure that that probably isn&#8217;t the fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s probably a whole bunch of different security vulnerabilities that we need to be aware of, as well as different ways to fix those. So just paint the landscape of WordPress security, if you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:04] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> Sure. To start off with, we can start with the WordPress Core. Many people think that WordPress is insecure in the Core. But yeah, if you ask me like 10, 12 years ago, I would&#8217;ve said yeah. But nowadays, I mean, WordPress in general, the Core, is a really robust, solid product. So WordPress is not an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course WordPress is surrounded, is made up from a huge ecosystem of plugins and themes. And nowadays of course, there are a lot of different solutions. And most issues usually are either user problems, lack of awareness. Or vulnerabilities, issues in plugins. But yeah, in terms of security, like it&#8217;s usually a mix of tools. It&#8217;s a mix of services, tools, the plugins for example, or services. Or a mix of both. And also best practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You definitely, for example, if you have a bare bone WordPress, you need some plugins and services to implement some things and automate. Like add two factor authentication. Implement a firewall. Automate backups. Enforce some policies, for example. That&#8217;s what the software can give you, but you also need to follow some best practices. You know like, let&#8217;s say have some logs, an activity log. You need to keep an eye on those logs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to make sure that the software is always up to date. And by the way when we talk software, many people look just at WordPress, but you need to also keep up to date your own laptop software up to date. Any software you use through the process, your laptop, servers, whatever, everything needs to be kept up to date, not just WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course one thing to keep in mind is, let&#8217;s say you harden WordPress the first time. Security is not a one stop fix. It&#8217;s not a one time fix. Because it&#8217;s secure maybe today. But as we all know, as businesses grow, as requirements change your website needs to adapt to these changes. So you might need to add new technology. Or you need to install any new plugin, or change something, or change the configuration on the server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with every change, or with any new vulnerability that is discovered, make sure that you adapt your security strategy basically. What we call like the four pillars of security. The idea is of course first to secure, harden WordPress. Then of course monitor. Keep an eye of course, on what&#8217;s happening. Test, just keep on testing whenever you add something new. Is the firewalls still working as it&#8217;s supposed to be? Things like that. Based on findings, you need to improve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as the website evolves, as your business evolves or your, whatever you are doing with the website, the scope of the website, and the requirements of your team. Security needs to evolve as well. Okay, install a plugin. You maybe use some services as well, a good mix. You have some best practice in place, but yeah, that&#8217;s just as of today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s a never-ending enterprise really, isn&#8217;t it? You are constantly going to have to be tweaking this and examining this because the nature of the software, which WordPress itself sits on top of, the OS if you like, that&#8217;s always changing. WordPress itself is changing. The configuration of plugins, themes, and so on that you&#8217;ve got is changing. And also the nature of the attacks, which are coming your way is changing. The long and the short of it is the whole thing is changing. And so I guess you need to adapt with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just want to switch to the attackers themselves, because I always find this subject curious. What is in it for them? So these days we constantly see about the latest hack. You know, if you read tech journalism, you are seeing about SaaS platforms going down. You see about ransomware attacks. You see about people&#8217;s Bitcoin wallets being stolen and there&#8217;s just seemingly every which way that people can because mayhem, they do. But in a WordPress website, why are they doing it? What are the reasons that they&#8217;re doing it for? I guess we&#8217;ve come a long way from just so that they can deface your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:27] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> I&#8217;ve been listening to this podcast. It&#8217;s about the Lazarus group. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard about it. It&#8217;s from the BBC. Typically on the scale of attacks the motivation is mostly financial motivation. And okay, of course, like you don&#8217;t have any source of money or something on your website. This might not be the case. But these type of large scale attacks, they need a number of bots. Basically hacked websites, hacked servers, which they can use to ramp up their attacks basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or of course, if you want to hide, if you&#8217;re hacking a website, you&#8217;re going to hide yourself. You don&#8217;t want to hack it from your own computer. So you hack a website, you hack another server and use that kind of like a stepping stone. So as long as you have an online presence, whether it&#8217;s WordPress or not you are a target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That online presence, if it&#8217;s WordPress or not, any website or any device that is connected to the internet. It has resources. It has CPU power. It has memory. It has internet connectivity, bandwidth. So yeah, that&#8217;s a resource. Now, if it&#8217;s being hacked either to hack your website and deface website, or as a stepping stone to hack something else. But yeah, you are always target. So even if you have nothing of interest, even if you&#8217;re not doing, I don&#8217;t know, commerce to your website, and if you don&#8217;t have sensitive data, you are still a target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If you have an e-commerce website, obviously there&#8217;s a real motivation there. You know, possibly break into your website and figure out what kind of orders have been replaced and cause mayhem there. And maybe try some sort of social engineering attack to steal people&#8217;s credit card details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But interestingly there you also just said just the resources itself, that&#8217;s enough. The fact that you have paid for a piece of a computer somewhere, a portion of a computer, the CPU and what have you. That&#8217;s enough for people because presumably they want to put their own software on the computer that you&#8217;ve paid for, and use it to do nefarious things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, that button means spraying out emails to people who don&#8217;t wish to receive them. But what other things are they up to? So if they&#8217;re not defacing things, but they are wishing to take your machine over. What kind of things can they do from there, once they&#8217;ve got that bridge established?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:23] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> They can do quite a lot. For example, there was this, going back to the Lazarus group, one of the smart hacks they&#8217;ve done. They targeted some bankers, some people who work in banks basically with a phishing attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quite frankly, it was the good old trick, like hi, you have won an award. Click here to win via email. Uh, someone from all those thousands of employees in a bank, someone clicked. And malware was injected there. And that led to allowing them to control some ATMs and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to get to there, when they managed to inject the malware in ATMs and of course control that, they wouldn&#8217;t control that malware, or launch the attack from their own servers. Because otherwise it&#8217;s very easy to track them back. They need some sort of proxies or stuff like that. So basically they&#8217;re going to use your website, which is hosted on a server. The resources of your website, of the server where your website is hosted to launch this attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not the first time actually, they have multiple proxies. So from their machine, they send commands to your hacked website, which sends commands to another hacked website, as in hacked server, and then it sends the comment to the actual victim. The resources you&#8217;re paying for, the server you&#8217;re paying for, is being used purely for them to hide themselves basically as a proxy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess one of the things that I hear sometimes is that people believe that because their website is of a small size, or may not be interesting, in inverted commas, that they therefore assume that the hackers won&#8217;t find it interesting. In other words, it goes a little bit like this, but my website&#8217;s small. You know, it&#8217;s about something really niche. Why would the hackers want to come after me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think what you&#8217;ve just said speaks to that. It&#8217;s irrelevant. It&#8217;s not really a hacker. There isn&#8217;t an individual doing this. It&#8217;s an individual at some point who wrote a script, which then got downloaded and redistributed a thousand times over the internet and deployed by a thousand different people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you don&#8217;t need to look for an incentive. The incentive is there all the time. It&#8217;s not a person deliberately coming after you for a personal vendetta, usually. This is just people trying to gain some sort of bridgehead in the internet, on the internet, on servers somewhere so that they can because mayhem in ways that you cannot even imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:31] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> Yeah. In fact, even when you say, okay, I don&#8217;t know, I have a website about a hobby, some old museum somewhere, whatever. We don&#8217;t accept payments. Who would be interested in our website? From the outside it doesn&#8217;t apply, because when actually hackers are trying to find, or malicious users are trying to find vulnerable websites. They&#8217;re not just browsing one by one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have automated tools. They scan whole subnets, whole networks, you know. And they don&#8217;t even know or care whose website it is, or how it looks most of the time. Okay, this website has a vulnerability, we can exploit it. So of course we can run commands, you know, on the operating system or depending of course, what they want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, as long as they get access. So yeah, they don&#8217;t just target your website, just scan whole subnets. So, your website happens to be one of them. So yeah, if you have a vulnerability, if you have, I don&#8217;t know, an outdated plugin for example that has an issue, and you&#8217;ve never updated it and the vulnerability is there and they can exploit it, then yeah. They don&#8217;t care whose website it is or how it looks, whatever. It just, it flags okay, this website, they get a flag, this website is vulnerable. Exploit the attack, take over, and that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And I guess the other important part in that, is that this is not a personal thing. It&#8217;s very, very, very unlikely, unless you are some kind of nation state actor, that there&#8217;s going to be people sitting at computers designing software deliberately to get into your machine. This is just people spraying out bots all over the place, looking for vulnerabilities and then stumbling across them randomly, and then deploying the things that they&#8217;ve got to exploit, those vulnerabilities. So it&#8217;s not personal, and it&#8217;s very unlikely at the other end of that is a real human being. It&#8217;s just scripts written, who knows where and who knows when.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:05] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> Exactly. No, in fact, I&#8217;m sure like the bigger companies, you know, like Facebook. I&#8217;m sure they have a good share of targeted attacks because when you&#8217;re so big, I mean they definitely have some haters. But no, let&#8217;s say the normal websites, the normal hobbyist websites, whatever, which is quite funny because usually the hobbyist websites are the ones that people think, oh, who will attack my website? But yeah, it&#8217;s just like another number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s not personal, it&#8217;s nothing personal. And as you said, most probably not, most probably, like most of the things are automated. So yeah, there&#8217;s not one person doing something to you, it&#8217;s just the whole process and it&#8217;s all automated. So yeah, nothing personal indeed, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, which doesn&#8217;t make it any better unfortunately, even though it&#8217;s not personal. So let&#8217;s talk about the tech stack which our WordPress websites are sitting upon. Because again caveat emptor. I know that a lot of the people who are listening to this who are technical, this will be very obvious what we&#8217;re going to cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s a proportion of the people who are listening to this who may very well not know that there is layers and layers of things making their website possible, and those themselves are vulnerable. Even though you may never interact with them. You may only go to your WordPress, log in over there. Type whatever it is that you need to type, save, publish, and then log out again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might be your only interaction with WordPress. But WordPress doesn&#8217;t sit in isolation. So what typically is the stack that it&#8217;s sitting on, and do we need to be concerned about all of the stack, or are there any pieces which are more concerning than others?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:30] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> It really depends. First of all, your own computer. So if you&#8217;re accessing your WordPress website, even just to update. Your own computer needs to be up to date. So that&#8217;s part of the tech stack. In regards to the website, it depends like if you have managed hosting where you have access just to this website, the bulk of the work, you still have to take care of some things and updating your software, but the bulk of the work is done by the web host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you have a dedicated server or just any hosting where you just have to install WordPress, then of course because a typical, let&#8217;s say you have a dedicated server, you host everything yourself. The typical text tech stack, you have the web server, typically a Unix, Linux operating system. Then you have the web server, Apache, Nginx or something similar. You have also PHP, sort of like a framework, the language that WordPress is written in. You have MySQL the database server, that&#8217;s the most basic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you have PHP, Apache, the web server itself of course, and the database. And then of course it depends, like if you need to send emails, you&#8217;re going to have the SMTP server and stuff like that. So when it comes to securing that, let&#8217;s say that one. To be honest when you look at the tech stack software nowadays, it&#8217;s quite easy to keep secure as in like, as long as you configure it properly and securely. Like you read maybe a bit, I don&#8217;t know about the, the best practices, and of course keeping it up to date. Software in general is not a big issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more time passes, I think the last few years we&#8217;re seeing a small shift, because usually it was always, okay exploiting this issue or exploiting this issue. But most of the cases vendors are quite responsive on their issues. The problem in the tech stack, it&#8217;s not actually any component in the tech stack, it&#8217;s the users. As in like, it could be even, you&#8217;re like, if you forgot to update a plugin or if you received a spam email or a phishing attack and you clicked on some untrusted link. Or downloaded something which you, you don&#8217;t know what it is, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many tools nowadays when it comes to keeping your software up to date. There are so many resources. Like, listen, let&#8217;s read the best practices on how to set up a secure Apache server. And there are also, of course, services. You can pay people, you can pay professionals who can do these things for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the actual tech stack is, I wouldn&#8217;t say easy, because you need knowledge to do it, but yeah, it&#8217;s relatively easy if you know what you&#8217;re doing. You have the tools, you have everything you need to keep it secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem nowadays more weak passwords, phishing attacks, and stuff like that. Using public WiFi, using unpatched computers. Using public computers to access some things. Unfortunately the user has become the weakest link in the whole chain, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you&#8217;ve got to really be careful what it is that you&#8217;re doing. What machine you&#8217;re using. Where you&#8217;re using that machine, and so on. I&#8217;m just wondering if there is, in your mind, any system which you would regard as pretty safe. I&#8217;m going to say a hundred percent safe, and then immediately withdraw that because I think we all know that&#8217;s not possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But is there a position you can get into where you can have done enough. You&#8217;ve raised your guard up so much that you can relax? Or is this more a story of constant vigilance, constant worry, constantly assuming the worst is going to happen tomorrow? Or is it possible to employ the services of a particular, say, SaaS company, or a professional who might look over things for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And be entirely happy that, okay, that&#8217;s now handled by somebody else. I&#8217;m entirely safe. Now I know that a hundred percent is off the table, but can we be confident that our sites are mostly safe if we take the right precautions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:51] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> Yes. I think nowadays with all the tools that there are and all the services even the web hosts themselves, they really up to their game the last few years, especially the managed ones. As you said, a hundred percent is, you&#8217;re never guaranteed. But yeah, there are so many tools. If you inform yourself and if you implement some best practices, you websites are relatively safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, you should always take precaution steps. Like for example, backups, they&#8217;re very important. So if something happens, you can restore. Test those backups, of course, because many people miss that part. They take backup, like, have you ever tried to restore it? No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it is very important. because sometimes of course, it&#8217;s software as well and it can break. So the restore might not work or something has been corrupted. So that is extremely important. But yeah, from the tech stack point of view it&#8217;s pretty much covered. There are a lot of options nowadays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even like with a simple managed WordPress hosting, and installing a plugin or two, you&#8217;re pretty much covered, let&#8217;s say. What&#8217;s important is the best practice and the concept that listen, security is not one stop shop. I don&#8217;t think we should, one should be really paranoid to be honest. because as I said, we&#8217;re in a good position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s very important for people to keep in mind, especially as the team grows. Because if you&#8217;re on your own one thing, it&#8217;s relatively easy because you know, you have exactly full control between you and the web host. You have roughly full control of, and you know what&#8217;s happening. But as the team starts growing, especially nowadays, in the WordPress ecosystem it&#8217;s very common to have remote businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have full control of your employees, as in like, not the employees themselves, but as in their machines and where they use them and how they use them. So I think what&#8217;s very important is of course to raise awareness, train them, train your team. Make them aware that, listen, use your laptop here, or have some sort of guidelines and make sure you can use as many possible tools, documentation, and training to make sure at least you can take care of that part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is, in my opinion, is the hardest part to secure. Because of course, you don&#8217;t have full control of users, users machines. That is the most important, because as I said the tech stack, like of course things can happen, but as long as you keep software up to date and stuff like that, unless there&#8217;s a zero day exploit, you really unlucky whatever. Okay, it&#8217;s never a hundred percent secure, but you are very near that number, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In terms of the tech stack and the maturity of it, do we often get really innovative and unique vulnerabilities in the tech stack that builds a WordPress website? Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve got, I don&#8217;t know, a server, Apache Nginx or whatever it may be.. Do we ever find a new, novel attack? Does that typically come across, I don&#8217;t know, once a year, once a decade, something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So can we lower our guards a little bit or do we find, do you find, you&#8217;re the expert? Do you find that there are novel things that are uncovered by security researchers, which have been, maybe they&#8217;ve been exploited for a year or more, but kept very much under the radar, kept quiet. Is the landscape changing? Are there new and novel attacks happening all the time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:40] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> Not really, in terms of vulnerabilities. We&#8217;re still playing with the same, for example, SQL injection was discovered in the late nineties. The first decade of 2000 we started discovering other vulnerabilities, like cross size scripting, cross request forgery, you know, and the other ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you discover a new type of vulnerability that I would say, of course, that is very innovative. But for the last 10 years, even if you look, there are some websites which keep kind of like an aggregate of the vulnerabilities that are found in plugins. It&#8217;s always the same, especially cross site scripting is very common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By cross site scripting, it&#8217;s also very important to like every different types of cross site scripting, different type of vulnerabilities, have different type of severity. So if a plugin has a cross site scripting vulnerability, it&#8217;s not necessarily that one should panic, because I&#8217;m not saying, okay, just relax, take it easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But listen, some of the vulnerabilities, for example, are very, very hard or can be exploited in a very particular edge case. So it is very important to keep things up to date. But yeah, in terms of innovation, no. In terms of new vulnerabilities, not much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is really changing? I think the way malicious users are getting much smarter in the way they craft their attack. They&#8217;re still using the same exploits and same, same issues. Exploiting old software, old vulnerabilites. The good old SQL injection, cross my scripting. But the way they are approaching it, the way they are building, drafting their tech, it&#8217;s much more complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of intelligence behind it, like how they use a number of different vulnerabilities to build an attack. First you send an email. If the victim gets the bait basically, if they click something or whatever. And then if they click, for example, install some malware on the computer, which allows you then, for example, I don&#8217;t know, some sort of key logger, and then you see what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe they are connecting to a website and they&#8217;re uploading something. So we&#8217;ve seen much more complex type of attacks where people are stringing a number of vulnerabilities together to successfully attack some particular target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in terms of innovation of new type of vulnerabilities, like new ways of exploiting software, we haven&#8217;t seen much, no. For the last 10 years, it&#8217;s been pretty much same old, same old kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now I&#8217;m going to throw a spanner in the works here and ask you about AI. It&#8217;s all the rage at the moment for creating content and probably people in the WordPress space know that people have been able to create plugins, and create all sorts of things around the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lots and lots of endeavors in WordPress using AI, and I&#8217;m wondering if this has started to become a trend amongst the hackers as well? Whether they&#8217;re using this technology to refine their processes? Possibly to go and look at the source code of things like WordPress or Linux kernel, or whatever it may be. Speeding up the process, finding new novel things. My question really boils down to, does AI and internet security, is that a point of concern, do you think, in the near future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:31] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> I think right now, not really. It&#8217;s still too early, but I think AI is a big changer in general, in every industry, every vertical of the internet industry. Having said that, AI is not a human, so it&#8217;s not necessarily coming up with something innovative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s still, at the end of the day, it still has some sort of database where it gets information from. The difference is that nowadays, instead of using Google and browsing through search results, trying to find exactly what you need, okay, this website, no, it&#8217;s not here to click on the other one, go on that page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than going through that process of course, with AI, we&#8217;ve really accelerated that. We&#8217;ve really automated that. So nowadays, like with AI, especially if you know how to ask what you need, you&#8217;re going to get the answer much quicker. So things that usually would take you, let&#8217;s assume a malicious user wants to hack something, a target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It used to take them days or weeks maybe to craft something and to think of something original and learn about something. Because of course you have to search for everything and read a bit more, and try this and try that. With AI, of course you&#8217;re accelerating this process. And by accelerating that process you&#8217;re achieving much quicker results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And typically also, true AI, not because AI cannot come up with something new, because it&#8217;s always getting information from what there is. But I&#8217;m pretty sure it can, because of this fast process, I&#8217;m pretty sure it will lead slowly, slowly to also new innovations. In every aspect, content writing, security, security both in terms of attack and defense and every aspect of the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s an interesting point. I hadn&#8217;t really thought about that. I was thinking about that from the attacker side. But of course, the defense side also has the same tools to deploy, and I&#8217;m imagining that if you&#8217;re the vendor of a, of a security product, whether that&#8217;s a firewall or a plugin or whatever, you&#8217;re also going to be deploying the same tools to try and mitigate what the adversaries are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:17] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> The thing is that luckily both the attacker and the, let&#8217;s say the white hat vendor have access to the same tools. So yeah, if you use them wisely. Also, this thing is always a bit of a cat and mouse game. The malicious users do something, the vendors up their game, then they do something, then they up their game and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I want to just turn our attention to a typical WordPress user. Perhaps somebody who really doesn&#8217;t know a great deal about this. They&#8217;re listening to this podcast because they&#8217;re curious about WordPress. They&#8217;ve got a site which they run, it&#8217;s their own. Maybe they&#8217;ve got a couple of sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re beginning that journey on creating their own freelance business or something like that. Do you have any guidance as to how often things ought to be done? Is this really a process of you really should be logging in every day, checking for updates, and while you&#8217;re at it, why not just switch automatic updates for Core and all the plugins that you&#8217;ve got on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or is this more of a look, once a week is fine. I&#8217;m sure there won&#8217;t be a hard and fast rule, but people who are just beginning their journey with WordPress, they probably do need concrete examples of how they should best handle this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:18] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> It really depends on the scale of the business and how much traffic your website is getting. And also the number of people working on the website. Because one person or two people from the same room, it&#8217;s totally different than being even two people from different locations. And how much the team is security savvy, not necessarily technical, but at least have some basic understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, in general let&#8217;s say a typical startup where you are switching between kind of like a transitioning from a hobby to a part-time. I think as long as you take care of the obvious, install some plugins, add 2FA, add some logs, add a firewall, make sure that you have backups. Work with a solid web host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as you take care of the basics, you should be pretty much covered, and yes, like everyone else, for example checking Google Analytics, or any type of analytics software for that matter. Yeah like, people are doing it for SEO, but it also helps keeping an eye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe there&#8217;s a spike of traffic coming from some unusual location. All these things can lead to something. Check your website every day. You know, like it&#8217;s very important, for example especially if you have a very small number of users. You are two or three users. I mean like once a week, maybe you should have some sort of checklist, you know, check how many users are on your website. Run some file integrated scans. You know, like some basic stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a week is more than enough at that level. So yes. But what&#8217;s important, I think at that stage, especially if you are growing, it&#8217;s very important to draft policies and follow security best practices when the team is still very small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Because if you are not organized when the team is very small, it&#8217;ll be much harder, and you&#8217;ll have much bigger problems when the team is very big. It&#8217;ll be much harder to implement a change. Like, I don&#8217;t know, like we used to do something one way, and after one year, the team now is a hundred people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s much more difficult to convince those hundred people, listen, we&#8217;re going to change this and we&#8217;re going to start doing it this way. And yeah, this can of course, irritate people because people tend to resist change, especially if it affects their productivity or if it&#8217;s too complicated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think what matters is, especially as you&#8217;re starting, set up some policy, some guidelines, some best practice for yourself, have some sort of checklist. Yes, once a week or so. You can also do it almost once a month, but again, play it safe. Why not spend an hour every week, have a checklist, check how many users are there on your website, check some logs, check the traffic on the website, you know, check the list of plugins. check the files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially, a file integrity monitor can tell you lot of things because if there is a file, typically when a website is hacked, there is a file that has changed. A file has been deleted, or a file has been modified, even an actual legitimate file, it has been modified. So yeah, that can tell you a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily nowadays, of course most of these systems, configure email alerts, you can configure some SMS and stuff like that. So of course you&#8217;re automating much and much more. But it&#8217;s still good to take a look. And also it&#8217;s very important because we, for example, we develop an activity log plugin, and some people are, okay, what should I look for in the logs? It&#8217;s very difficult to answer that question, because it truly depends on your business. Because, it&#8217;s very important for website owners to understand what&#8217;s running on their website and how it&#8217;s being used, and only then you can make informed decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, is this log, not just in WordPress, even the web server logs, even in analytics. Is this traffic normal or not? Because, if for example you are based in the UK and typically you get all the traffic from Germany. So by seeing a spike from traffic in Germany, that&#8217;s normal to you. But for someone who&#8217;s based in the UK but only has UK traffic, a spike of traffic in Germany is a problem for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So first what&#8217;s very important is to understand your website, have some basic checklists. The most basic stuff, once a week or so. Keep an eye on these things. Traffic, and logs usually, and also log into the website. Why not? You know, just go to the plugins page. Are these all the plugins that I installed? Are these all users that I had? That&#8217;s a really good step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By setting those best practices and those checks once a week, as the team grows it&#8217;ll be easier to maybe add something new because of course the team is growing, so you need to add more policies or you need to add, secure something else, you know? So, yeah, that&#8217;s very important. It&#8217;s very important to keep an eye on things, just check how things are running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course with managed web hosting, especially for WordPress things, most of these things are almost covered for you. Many web hosts have different packages. Many web hosts nowadays they have their own kind of like internal monitoring systems as well. We&#8217;ve noticed you have this plugin, which is outdated, or we&#8217;ve noticed this. So at least there is a lot going on for you already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s why I said even earlier, it&#8217;s good of course, to be aware, and to be conscious that, listen, these things can happen, but we don&#8217;t need to be stressed. If you&#8217;ve done your homework, if you do your own homework, and you follow best practices, you choose a good web host and stuff like that, then you are in a good place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I guess it&#8217;s a good point to mention that the WordPress ecosystem, given its enormous size and reach in the website creation space, you&#8217;re in a pretty good spot because there has been so much effort poured into, not only making WordPress secure, but making the update system for plugins and themes trivially easy to switch on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m just wondering about that one actually. I&#8217;m just wondering what your thoughts are on automatic updating. Personally I&#8217;ve, in most of the places where it&#8217;s possible, I have switched that on, and have had no negative consequences. You know, none of the plugin updates have destroyed anything in ways which would make me want to switch that off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that is an option which I know that a lot of people don&#8217;t make use of, and I&#8217;m wondering what your thoughts are on that. So in the WordPress admin, it&#8217;s possible to automate the whole process of updating. It&#8217;ll just do it on a regular cycle if it knows there&#8217;s a WordPress plugin update, it&#8217;ll just do it for you and hopefully everything will work out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And obviously now we&#8217;ve got a safe mode built into WordPress not that long ago. So let&#8217;s just talk about that quickly. What do you think about automatically updating everything when possible?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:59] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> Speaking about ourselves, we have automatic updates on minor version updates. Because we have like 4.0.1, 4.0.2. We allow that. because yeah, most cases, usually these updates are just small bug fixes here and there. The chances of something breaking, especially with a plugin update is with major version changes, because of course the vendor has implemented a new feature or drastically changed a feature and stuff like that. Of course, for the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, especially for vendors, it&#8217;s very difficult. Let&#8217;s say you have a plugin, it&#8217;s installed onto a hundred thousand websites. It is very difficult to simulate all those a hundred thousand websites, and simulate upgrades. So of course we try our best to do as much as we can to test as much as we can in different scenarios. But it&#8217;s impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in terms of auto updates, for us and which is something I recommend, I would definitely enable them for minor version updates. In regards to major version upgrades, nowadays again, most hosting providers have the staging websites. Just run it on the staging website, literally, it only takes 10 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Run it on the staging website. Check the area on the website that is affected by that plugin. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s an SEO plugin, for example, you check that the headers are still loading or the metadata is still loading. Or if, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s the tables plugin, check that tables are still loading properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yeah, if it works, update the live site as soon as possible. WordPress itself of course, as soon as you log into the dashboard, and you go to the plugins pages, you have that even, you don&#8217;t need to go to the plugins pages. You have that icon that you have updates. So it&#8217;s very difficult to miss updates. So that&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even if, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re not logging into your website on a daily basis, there are many services, every vendor usually they have their own change log, you can subscribe to their newsletter. So yeah, whenever there&#8217;s an update, you&#8217;ll get an email or some sort of notification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s very important if you&#8217;re not logging into your website every day to see when there are updates. At least subscribe to the vendor&#8217;s newsletter or builds updates or something. So at least you get an email that, listen, we&#8217;ve released an update, especially if it&#8217;s a major update. If you have, of course, the automatic updates for minor version upgrades, especially if you have a big website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like an e-commerce website, you can have a good number of plugins, tons of plugins. At least you don&#8217;t have to do almost daily updates. For the major version updates, if it&#8217;s a relatively small website, you might get on with enabling, automatic updates on that as well. But yeah, do it on a staging website. It literally takes a few minutes. Just update the plugin on the staging, run a quick test, 15 minutes maximum and turn on updates on the live website. So yeah, definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s also the kind of thing that once you&#8217;ve done it a few times, it becomes kind of muscle memory and you can do that staging to updating plugin to, you can do that very trivially quickly and get on with your day if that&#8217;s not the main part of your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just one last question. You talked earlier about members of staff and what have you. I&#8217;m just wondering if you&#8217;ve got any guidance, again possibly for the more inexperienced WordPress user, about the kind of roles that you might assign to people in WordPress. Obviously, if you are giving everybody the administrator role, you may well find yourself in a bit of trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also about the nature of cleansing out the users that you&#8217;ve got on your WordPress website on a regular basis. So, you know, if you&#8217;ve got a big team and you&#8217;re constantly churning through staff, that&#8217;s probably something you want to be thinking about as well, because that&#8217;s an attack that you really can&#8217;t avoid if you don&#8217;t make the effort. You know, if you&#8217;ve given somebody an administrator account and they&#8217;ve got bonafide access to get into the website and you don&#8217;t revoke it. Or you&#8217;ve given them too many permissions and they then get fired and you know, they fall out with you, there could be problems afoot there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:19] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> Yeah, indeed. Definitely one shouldn&#8217;t give admin roles, assign the admin role to everyone. In fact, as a best practice, I would say have an admin account, really difficult to use and that should only be used by you and only as back up. Because even you as a website administrator, you don&#8217;t need admin access whenever you log into the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If most of your work is still updating some posts, or maybe changing something from the theme. So no, admin roles shouldn&#8217;t be used that often. WordPress has a number of built-in roles. It depends again on the nature of the website, what you&#8217;re doing with it. For some people, those roles work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, the fact that there&#8217;s this technology of roles is, it&#8217;s already good, because there are also a number of plugins which you can use to create different types of roles to assign multiple roles to users. And most plugins nowadays they either create their own roles on your WordPress website, or they have different types of functions where you can, okay, like, literally some plugins, you can say, okay, I created a new role for them and I want these people to do only these type of things on this plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the role control, and what people can do and cannot do, especially when you use a third party plugin to create your own custom roles and to assign different privileges, is very granular. Definitely no admin access for no people, quite frankly. But yeah, the rest, I definitely recommend using some sort of custom role editor so you can create your own custom roles as well if the default ones don&#8217;t work for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We always talk about the principle of least privilege. I was a systems engineer when I used to work for their companies and, the easiest way, I was like, yeah, give them admin access because it&#8217;ll work for sure. Of course. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a very common practice. But no, the reality is you should, yes, start with the least possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if they don&#8217;t work, see what else they need. Okay. What else do you need? I need to access this page from this plugin, and check. Contact the vendor from the plugin. Listen, do you have specific privileges for this? Or do we need this? Do we need this? And to build slowly. Yes, I understand that it hinders the productivity, kind of slows down things. But it only slows those things for a day or two. Or give them maybe a bit more access for a day or two until you check with the vendor and then reverse that access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So always give the least possible. It&#8217;s also a question like of user accountability. Some compliance bodies actually have regulations about this. If someone shouldn&#8217;t be seeing certain customer data, regardless if you trust them or not, they shouldn&#8217;t be seeing it. Why are you giving them access kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s very important to live by the kind of like principle of lease privilege when it comes to users. Give them the lease possible. Even for them, especially if they&#8217;re not tech savvy. This doesn&#8217;t have to do with someone being malicious, or even if they make a mistake, at least they make a mistake within their environment, their privileges. Not a bigger mistake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roles definitely should be used. And yeah, there are a lot of plugins. We&#8217;re lucky because there are a lot of plugins which allow you to create your own custom roles, assign different privileges for roles and stuff like that. Definitely roles are definitely things that should be used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This is a topic that we could probably talk about for days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:08] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> Yeah, roles on their own, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And more broadly about WordPress in general. You know, should we keep the REST API on, and are there a bunch of things that you would switch off by default. But unfortunately we&#8217;re kind of running out of time, so I&#8217;m going to leave those questions possibly for another episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or another way of getting the answer might be, if people want to contact you, Robert, directly. Where can you be found? Do you hang out on social? Is there an email address that you prefer to mention? Where can we best find you, Robert?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:37] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> Yes. Uh, our website is wpwhitesecurity.com but as I said, we are rebranding. So we are announcing the new name at WordCamp Europe. The new website will be melapress.com. m e l a press.com. So yeah, my email is very simple, robert at melapress.com or at WP White Security. I&#8217;m also on Twitter and stuff like that. But yeah, I think email is definitely one of the most efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you very much, Robert. I really appreciate joining us on the podcast today. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:02] <strong>Robert Abela:</strong> Thank you. Thank you very much.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/robert681/\">Robert Abela</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert is the CEO and founder of <a href=\"https://melapress.com/\">MelaPress</a>, formerly known as WP White Security. They make niche WordPress security and admin plugins. He has over 18 years experience in the IT and software industries, and has written numerous web security articles and white papers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that your website is potentially under attack 24 hours a day, 365 days of this year, but why is that, and what can we do to mitigate that risk?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert talks about the security of WordPress Core and how it’s matured over the years. He feels that in most cases, it’s not the Core of WordPress that you need to be concerned about, rather the array of plugins and themes which are added on top. The unique cocktail of software that you add to your site makes it challenging for security products to secure it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, Robert is optimistic that there are strategies you can adopt which will make your site less likely to fall prey to malicious actors or bots. Updating plugins on a regular basis, keeping fresh backups, and the monitoring of logs all play a vital role and are straightforward to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert is also at pains to point out that this is not a one click, or one time fix. You’re going to need to dedicate time and resources to your website security, and those resources and time will need to be increased as the importance and reach of your site grows. Evolution is the key here. What worked yesterday might not work so effectively tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another topic which we touch on is the automated nature of many of these attacks. Unless you are hosting a website of some importance, hackers are not trying to break your specific website. They’re deploying automated attacks, trying to infect many websites at the same time. But why do they do this, what are the motivations of these bad actors? Robert explains that it’s not personal, but that does not mean that you can ignore the threat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also chat about the many layers which go into making your website work. Typically you’ve got a web server, a database, and often much more, and Robert explains why you need to be mindful of all these when drawing up your security posture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then of course there’s the users of your site, the people who you’ve allowed to have legitimate access to the WordPress admin. If you’re in a large company with a high churn of employees then you’ll need to make sure that only people who need access have access, and that the permissions that they’re afforded are correct for the work they need to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re curious about how you can secure your WordPress website as it grows, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/\">WP White Security</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://melapress.com/\">Melapress</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Matt: WordCamp Europe Keynote\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=87795\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"https://ma.tt/2023/06/wordcamp-europe-keynote/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:438:\"<p class=\"is-style-matt-rothko-style\">I had a great time at <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Europe in Athens</a> this year, here&#8217;s the keynote &#8220;Variations on a Theme&#8221; with presentations from <a href=\"https://josepha.blog/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a> and <a href=\"https://matiasventura.com/\">Matías Ventura</a>, and Q&amp;A from all three of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 10:06:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"WPTavern: WordPress Accessibility Day Secures Nonprofit Status for Annual Event, Calls for Speakers and Sponsors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=145758\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:115:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-accessibility-day-secures-nonprofit-status-for-annual-event-calls-for-speakers-and-sponsors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2527:\"<p>WordPress Accessibility Day, an independent 24-hour virtual conference, will <a href=\"https://2023.wpaccessibility.day/\">return in 2023</a> &#8211; this time under an official non-profit status. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first edition of the event was hosted in 2020 by the WordPress core Accessibility Team. They wanted to manage it independently of the WordPress Foundation in order to reserve the option to do things like pay speakers for their time and expertise. The most recent 2022 event ran its finances through  WP Accessibility Day Board President Amber Hinds&#8217; company, Equalize Digital,   to expedite the process of getting started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of last year&#8217;s event, which drew 1,604 attendees from 52 countries, thanks to 28 sponsors and a 32-person volunteer crew, inspired organizers to keep pushing to make the organization a nonprofit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through a fiscal sponsorship partnership with <a href=\"https://knowbility.org/\">Knowbility</a>, an Austin-based digital accessibility advocate and services provider, WP Accessibility Day has secured 501(c)(3) nonprofit status. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When I helped found this event in 2020, I already knew that our biggest challenge would be ensuring that the event wasn’t dependent on a single person to survive,” WP Accessibility Day Board Secretary Joe Dolson said. “Setting up as a non-profit and partnering with a larger organization helps us reach our goal of creating an event with a life of its own. Knowbility’s dedication to accessibility education makes them a great match for our mission.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This arrangement makes sponsorships and donations to the WP Accessibility Day event tax-deductible in the United States. Past sponsors include Cloudways, Gravity Forms, WP Engine, Yoast, GoDaddy Pro, Weglot, among other WordPress companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next <a href=\"https://2023.wpaccessibility.day/\">WP Accessibility Day</a> event is scheduled for September 27-28, 2023, and will feature a single-track that runs for 24 hours. It will also include live captioning and sign language interpreters. Organizers plan to publish the sessions following the event with transcripts and updated captions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaker and sponsor applications are already open, and speakers will be compensated with a $300 stipend per session. The deadline to submit an application as a speaker has been <a href=\"https://2023.wpaccessibility.day/speaker-submission-deadline-extended/\">extended to June 18, 2023</a>.

Shortly after the announcement, instructions were published for theme and plugin authors to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2022/12/16/plugins-themes-categorization/\">opt into the new taxonomies</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new filters are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2023/06/13/new-filter-controls-discover-commercial-and-community-in-the-theme-and-plugin-directory/\">now enabled</a> on both the theme and plugin directories, giving users the ability to quickly sort between free community extensions and those with commercial upgrades. Anything with a &#8220;pro version&#8221; should be designated as Commercial. These usually come with some upsells for more features than are offered in the free version. So far, the number of themes identified as commercial vastly exceed the number of community themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In the Plugin directory, extensions designated as free are nearly equal those designated as commercial. Many of the most widely used plugins have already been identified as commercial, including Yoast SEO, Jetpack, Akismet, Elementor, WooCommerce, All-in-One WP Migration, and more. Examples of community plugins include the WordPress Importer, Classic Editor, Classic Widgets, Gutenberg, Performance Lab, and Debug Bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In both directories it appears only a small percentage of authors have designated their extensions using the commercial or community taxonomies. At this time, use of the taxonomies is not required. This gave rise to some questions in the comments of the announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Would a better classification system would be to just have either no label for the majority, and then something closer to &#8216;includes paid upgrades&#8217; that just implies they also offer additional services on top of their free (and often fully functional) version?&#8221; WordPress developer Kevin Batdorf said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All plugins are open source regardless of whether they sell something, and that doesn’t make those developers any less passionate about open-source. Nor does it imply non-commercial plugins have any less features, or that the level of dedication to support is any less dedicated.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Batdorf also asked if use of the taxonomies would be a requirement in the future, because, at the moment, their low usage could give some plugins an advantage under these new classifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Should it also be a requirement?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Otherwise this also seems like something to be gamed for visibility. Do Community or Commercial (or neither) plugins show higher install growth? I guarantee you people are tracking this already.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress&#8217; Meta team is seeking feedback on the current implementation. Automattic-sponsored contributor Steve Dufresne said &#8220;work is continuously underway to improve the browsing experience and refine the visual aspects of the Theme and Plugin Directory as part of the site redesign.&#8221; The new filters will be incorporated into the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2023/04/10/wordpress-org-redesign-update-2/\">upcoming redesign changes</a> that have been slowly rolling out across WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These filters will also be making their way into the admin theme and plugin browsers, so users can access them from wherever they search for extensions. In the meantime, users and theme and plugin developers can leave feedback via Meta Trac on the specific tickets outlined in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2023/06/13/new-filter-controls-discover-commercial-and-community-in-the-theme-and-plugin-directory/\">announcement</a>, as the team continues to iterate on the project.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 13 Jun 2023 04:11:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: WordCampers Demand Changes to Q&amp;A Format\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=145760\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcampers-demand-changes-to-qa-format\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5951:\"<p>Q&amp;A segments at a live event are a valuable point of connection where attendees have the opportunity to gain the undivided attention of the speaker or panelist and get answers to important questions.

If that is you, you may not even notice it, but you are seriously wasting people&#8217;s time, potentially harming the speaker, and preventing folks from actually learning something.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arntz suggested that those asking questions longer than a minute should forego the Q&amp;A time and ask the speaker informally at a later opportunity if it is relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Just to clarify, while some of the issues apply especially to sessions with more exposure, like a Matt Q&amp;A, they all also apply to any other session,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While these problems mostly occur due to individual folks in the audience, I think the WordCamp organization needs to take action to improve the situation as it&#8217;s been happening for years.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arntz proposed a number of actionable ideas, including submitting questions to a central platform where they can be upvoted by community members, discarding lengthy questions, and providing mandatory training or documentation for emcees on how to handle problematic Q&amp;A situations. He also noted that having questions in writing can assist non-native English speakers in understanding other non-native speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arntz also contends that Q&amp;A should be optional, depending on the speaker&#8217;s preference. This may also have the added effect of creating a more inclusive environment for speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Particularly for new speakers, it can cause lots of distress or anxiety, especially because, as mentioned before, it very often isn&#8217;t questions but any of the aforementioned problems,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All of this can be another blocker for folks from underrepresented groups to even apply to speak, which came up in the session on women &amp; non-binary folx of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Making Q&amp;A optional is a great and simple way to at least improve the latter issue while working on addressing all the other problems. It&#8217;s literally just a decision to make, so I urge the community and organizing teams to make it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arntz&#8217;s thread has received positive feedback and support, and other WCEU attendees have joined in with suggestions for improving the Q&amp;A format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Many other open source conferences use apps that do more with Q&amp;A, rating speakers, and even helping attendees schedule networking,&#8221; GoDaddy Developer Advocate Courtney Robertson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/courtneyr_dev/status/1668139699268120577\">said</a>. &#8220;The favorited events export to iCal/gCal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raymon Mens, a first-time-attendee at WCEU, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/raymonmens/status/1668146081496956933\">said</a> he was &#8220;negatively surprised by the Q&amp;A part&#8221; for every session. &#8220;I would have preferred some more time for the speaker to go more in depth and not have a long Q&amp;A that doesn’t add a lot.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jon Ang, an organizer for WordCamp Asia, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kenshino/status/1668223052155617281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1668223052155617281%7Ctwgr%5Ecb693e283a61a9b5b9ae45ea5f2e017df763ad60%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwptavern.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D145760action%3Dedit\">said</a> he is taking Arntz&#8217;s feedback into consideration for their next event, and future global leads for WCEU <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taekereijenga/status/1668238519477628929\">said</a> they are also discussing these ideas for next year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At WordCamp San Francisco 2011 there was a Q&amp;A session with Barry and it used a P2,&#8221; WordPress core committer Aaron Jorbin said. &#8220;For the off topic questions, others often chimed in. I think an MC with knowledge of the subject matter asking questions off this would be perfect.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Changes will likely originate from WordCamp organizers who can recognize the existing problems with the current Q&amp;A format and depart from tradition with a better way of bringing quality questions to speakers who wish to entertain them. Getting Q&amp;A right may also become a stronger priority as WordPress&#8217; community team <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-evolves-wordcamp-format-to-promote-adoption-training-and-networking-for-professionals\">evolves the WordCamp format to promote adoption, training, and networking</a>. Based on the feedback on Arntz&#8217;s Twitter thread, it&#8217;s past time to update the Q&amp;A format and WordCampers are eager to see it happen.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 12 Jun 2023 22:27:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.org blog: Twenty Years of WordPress at WCEU\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15167\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/06/twenty-years-of-wordpress-at-wceu/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4620:\"<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inspiring the global community</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The atmosphere was electric at WordCamp Europe (WCEU) 2023 in Athens, Greece, as WordPress celebrated its <a href=\"https://wp20.wordpress.net/\">20th anniversary</a> and the opportunity to gather in person for inspiration and engagement. More than 2,500 individuals from 94 countries came together in person or through the live stream to participate in a remarkable three-day event (plus Contributor Day) filled with talks, networking, and learning opportunities. The event concluded on June 10 with a captivating keynote address by WordPress co-founder <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, Executive Director <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a>, and Gutenberg Product Architect <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matveb/\">Matías Ventura</a>, who highlighted the advancements and upcoming milestones of the WordPress Project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One significant update shared during the keynote was the successful reactivation of WordCamps. This time last year, we organized eight in-person WordCamps, and by the end of 2022, the number had risen to 23. Thanks to the enthusiasm and involvement of the WordPress community, we are already on track to organize 25 WordCamps in the first half of this year alone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha also emphasized the importance of the upcoming Community Summit on August 22-23. This in-person gathering brings contributors together across the WordPress open source project, fostering cross-project discussions vital for future growth and sustainability. For more information, visit the official <a href=\"https://communitysummit.wordcamp.org/2023/\">Community Summit website</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/Five-for-the-Future-WCEU-1.png?resize=585%2C365&ssl=1\" alt=\"Total contributors: 7788 (737 new)\nContributors pledged to 5ftF: 780 (95 new)\n152 companies total with confirmed contributors (30 new)\" class=\"wp-image-15171\" width=\"585\" height=\"365\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Discussing the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future</a> (5ftF) program, Josepha highlighted the impressive growth in active contributors and company pledges over the past year. She also underscored the expansion of the WordPress ecosystem, citing examples like <a href=\"https://openverse.org/\">Openverse</a>, which now provides access to nearly 800 million images and audio files, all easily accessible in the Site Editor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another exciting addition to the WordPress repertoire is <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/\">WP Playground</a>. This new feature allows users to build WordPress applications instantly in the browser without needing a PHP server. This tool provides a swift and seamless experience, reducing the installation time from five minutes to a near-instantaneous 500 milliseconds. The application of WP Playground may seem like magic, but its practical application promises tangible and revolutionary benefits for WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías Ventura then took the stage to share updates on Gutenberg. Through a visually stunning video built entirely with blocks, he showcased the six-year development journey and the transition from words to blocks to a final design. The upcoming WordPress version 6.3 will mark the completion of the first two phases of Gutenberg, consolidating all these features into a cohesive and user-friendly experience. He also highlighted the introduction of features such as the Wayfinder tool, Style Book, and the ability to save patterns, further empowering users to own their web presence and voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the keynote presentation, the WordPress leadership engaged in a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzKiKRodHQ0\"> lively Q&amp;A session </a>with the audience, further illustrating the continuous evolution within the WordPress Project. This session highlighted how the WordPress community innovates, iterates, and continually improves to create a better platform for today and tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Join the global community and be part of the WordPress journey toward a brighter future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>cbringmann</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/eidolonnight/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>eidolonnight</a> for review and collaboration</em>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 10 Jun 2023 22:21:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"Jonathan Pantani\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"Matt: Whoop Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=87066\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"https://ma.tt/2023/06/whoop-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1293:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/\">Whoop</a> is an excellent biometrics bracelet I&#8217;ve been wearing for a few months since my friend <a href=\"https://jaimewaydo.com/\">Jaime Waydo</a> joined as their CTO.

They also discuss the importance of incorporating feedback into the product development process, utilizing user testing and testimonials to refine features and continually improve. The impact of their collaborative efforts has led to clarity around the momentum of partnering can bring to the creative process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Balancing Professionalism and Creativity</strong>. The balance between professionalism and creativity in branding and marketing can be difficult. Even for playful, fun brands, there is a need to maintain a level of professionalism. Clean designs, corporate markets, and conveying value to potential customers are important.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Using Feedback for Product Refinement</strong>. There is value in receiving feedback and incorporating it into the product development process. User testing, testimonials, and refining the features offer continual improvement opportunities. Creating a product that meets the needs of the target audience and continually improving it based on user feedback requires commitment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Leveraging Collaboration for Productivity</strong>. The productive nature of collaboration and bouncing ideas off each other is energizing. Take time to brainstorm, make suggestions, and provide insights that contribute to refining the product and marketing strategies with your teams. A collaborative approach helps generate new ideas, solve problems, and keep the momentum flowing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://crop.express/\">Crop.Express</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.omgimg.net/\">OMGIMG</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt\">ChatGPT</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lindseymillerwp\">Lindsey Miller</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-you-can-follow-post-status-and-our-guests-on-twitter\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f426.png\" alt=\"🐦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-wrapper\">\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/coreymaass\">Corey Maass</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> (CEO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\">Olivia Bisset</a> (Intern, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper has-background\">The <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4dd.png\" alt=\"📝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Browse our archives</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe via <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simplecast</a>, or <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Session 16 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>C&amp;C 16</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Everything sounds like a country song.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working from Panera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good, I got that</p>\n\n\n\n<p>screaming live on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently country music for me is all, um, ing.

Wound up doing a couple of pretty good re refactors again, of the plugin. Um, I, in in particular, I coded myself into a corner or had coded myself into a corner and then, um, putting things over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s sort of two versions of. In, in coding parlance you have instances of things, right? So there&#8217;s sort of two instances of the app. Um, one is sitewide and then one is per post or per. Per object. So attached to a podcast episode or attached to a post article or attached to something, you wanna have images, um, and then attached to the entire site, which in WordPress, there is no site thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so there&#8217;s, you know, these sort of two instances of apps and I had done a lot of coding initially. Where I had abstracted out for these two instances and then done a bunch of refactoring based on our conversations for the site-wide instance, and then porting that back over to apply to posts and things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it all broke, um, or I encoded myself into a corner in a number of ways. So I wound up just ripping it all out and simplifying it. So we&#8217;re real close. Um, but I&#8217;m between, uh, allergies and, uh, life getting in the way. I&#8217;ve been feeling a little burned out. Um, I messaged you the other night like I have, uh, you can hear me sniffle and, um, Yeah, and in insomnia that I suffer from once in a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;m staying up all night coding, which is not, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m coding because I&#8217;m up all night. I&#8217;m not staying up all night coding. But it, because of that, I tend to like burn out and I&#8217;m, I&#8217;ve also, I&#8217;ve solved these problems four times now. I just need to keep cleaning them up and keep revising them. So the truth is I&#8217;m taking a couple of days away from the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we&#8217;re close. I mean, I keep saying that week after week, but um, I do think that we&#8217;re, as soon as we get a logo locked down, which helps to find colors and styles, which helps to find the website, it also lets me go back into the app and plug in the logo in a couple of places and then, you know, it&#8217;s sort of branding complete version 0 0 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, you know, I think we can roll from there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:01] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. Um, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a great update. And then transitioning to the logo for a second. So it just made me think as I&#8217;m, I want, I want to talk through those logos that we were just talking through on Slack. I&#8217;ll screen share those in a second, but it just made me think I&#8217;m doing this horizontal one particularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. With the designer. And what are the needs for plugin? Like, do we need just a logo mark, for instance? Brandmark, whatever do we need to, what, what kind of ratios and sizes do you need?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Right. I, the, the, the one that I, we were talking about the most just a minute ago is horizontal omg i m g next to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>sorry. Um, oh, now we know all your secrets. So, uh, This one. I like the font choice, but the graphic is kind of meh, like it&#8217;s been done before. I like the colors. Um, this one I like conceptually better and I dropped in a few notes. I honestly think that they should take the font from the first one and do this treatment to it, simplifying it, taking out the drop shadow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I liked your suggestion of switch or reversing it. Um, and then the color&#8217;s up here. Exactly. So it&#8217;s bigger and bold. Yeah. And then, and then honestly, I think that&#8217;s good enough. Um, okay. The, so yeah, if they swap out the, the, the font, cuz then it&#8217;ll be, the font feels more square, big and bold, simple. And, and at that point, what I guess I anticipate doing is if you&#8217;ve got OMG next to img, um, it&#8217;s easy enough to put one on top of the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you might actually tell them like, you know, here are our notes and please com create one that is horizontal as they&#8217;re doing now, but, but one that&#8217;s stacked with OMG over img. So maybe the OMG is, is in color and the IMG is in black or something. Um, but honestly, that way we&#8217;ve got. I think we, we cover our bases, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a horizontal version and we&#8217;ve got a essentially a square version. Hey, you&#8217;re wondering if I&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:29] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> remembered? I&#8217;m sharing&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:30] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> my screen. I, I did. Yeah. I see that</p>\n\n\n\n<p>this is the true ride along entrepreneur ride along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like that ride along. Oh yeah. There&#8217;s a, a subreddit called Entrepreneur Ride Along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not a great subreddit, but I, I like the, I like the gist of it and some of it there occasionally. There&#8217;s a good question or a good post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And honestly, I, I will, I think instead of gray, it should be, it should be black and white, so it&#8217;s color going, but it, but we don&#8217;t, we can, I can change that when we get it. That&#8217;s fine. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So yeah, use that font, flip it upside down. Um, remove the drop shadow. I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t like that. The 3D effect of it doesn&#8217;t do anything for me,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>man.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:16] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I&#8217;m looking at where are you seeing shadow, like right here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:19] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, so that bar has a shadow below it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then lastly, if they make those changes, um, create a version where the OMG is above the img.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s, we, this is a, if this is a, a horizontal, ver horizontal version, we need a, yeah, it&#8217;s essentially a, a vertical version. Ooh, that&#8217;s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:53] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> awesome. The top could be colors, um, g the bottom, and there&#8217;s a bar. Okay, cool. Yep.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:00] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Let&#8217;s see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for anybody who asks, it&#8217;s, oh my gosh, images. Because we are non religiously affiliated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would say another version that is vertical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Okay. And I think, I think that&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the color choices. I like the feel of it and as we&#8217;ve talked about it, like we could, we could spend tons of time and effort, but good enough. It&#8217;s cute, it&#8217;s interesting. Like it, it does what I wanted. Um, whatever it was that I had in my head, I didn&#8217;t have any, you know, the requirements that were in my head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like bold and fun and interesting. The big, big heavy font like that to me says like O M G I M G, you know, it feels, it matches the name. Um, I like the colors vi, vibrant. Interesting. So&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:21] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I almost wonder, like on the vertical one, it&#8217;s like leave a little black on the omg. Mm-hmm. Like the bars maybe split a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, let me, that&#8217;s in, that&#8217;s in progress now. Great. Next thing I had was website and, um, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re in the space to be able to do this, but, um, just focused on logo and I only had time for logo, so I didn&#8217;t get website going, but the, I&#8217;m gonna go back on pod squeeze K card. Text content and I&#8217;ll just start getting buckets of text&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:06] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> for those blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I think if you wanna even just do it, um, flat, so on, you know, open up a Google Doc or something. Let&#8217;s look at the few different, um, websites that we&#8217;ve bookmarked for design and content. Um, and we found this awesome new site this morning, um, called, where&#8217;d it Go? Jelly Laid and their their welcome screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, how do we want to, how, how does one say it? Uh, we can be, we can be inspired by. Inspired by, so, Yeah, I mean, and, and big props to Jelly La um, j e l l y l a d e, whether, um, whether we&#8217;re we, we borrow from them or not. It&#8217;s a really neat site, well laid out, well thought out. Um, and there&#8217;s a number of overlap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number of overlaps where they, they&#8217;re creating screenshots and beautiful screenshots. So they&#8217;re one of those kinds of tools. We&#8217;re doing something a little different, but, you know, some of the UI elements end up being the same, creating, um, specific sized images and stuff like that, just like we were doing for Crop Express.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, but I like the, what I realized on, on looking at their site, um, where is it about, So here I can share. Maybe don&#8217;t need to do subtitles, I need to share the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re heavy on listing out features, not benefits. So, um, but we did like, uh, some of the, the wording. Um, for your website and social media, um, that resonated. So the, so anyway, we&#8217;ve got that guy and we&#8217;ve got, um, what did you say? Squeeze was the other one we really liked the look of. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, um, this one I just really liked. Again, running with the, the big, bold colors. Um, I just liked the big, bold fonts, so I think this might be a treatment that we look at doing, um, when we actually sit down and design our site. But it&#8217;s, uh, you know, if so, Yes. I don&#8217;t think we should sit here and, and try to actually mock up the site right now, but if we want to create essentially a, a, just a flat doc, because I mean, most standard websites, you, you have a hero era area with a title, a paragraph, and a call to action testimonials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve got, you know, list the three benefits kind of thing. I mean, most of these sites are pretty. Have similar sections. So I think if we go through and we can lock down just some wording. Um, and then once we have the colors and things from the logo set up, like we could just, we have text. We could just drop in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey, I&#8217;m gonna&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:49] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> start that. I can share it&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:51] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> with you. Cool. I&#8217;ll stop sharing. You could share a dot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the little back and forth in Slack we came up with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So this is very dry,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>but the tagline of, I&#8217;m just opening the doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, create professional images. Love that. One of the things that I reacted to, I realized thinking about the tagline, um, from, um, jelly La was there&#8217;s those create beautiful something, something and, you know, I&#8217;m like, well, beauty is at the behi in the eye of the beholder. And I always pry really hard not to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fall into words that are, it&#8217;s like the, the tagline that every, uh, every website tries at least once of the, the, the dot.dot that you&#8217;ll actually use, you know, and stuff like that. And it&#8217;s all just fluffy. So it&#8217;s like, I, I, I think you and I have talked about this before, like we&#8217;d rather it actually said what it did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:19] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I&#8217;m trying to go back and find, because you, you made some points, I think in Slack&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:25] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> that I wanna</p>\n\n\n\n<p>try to scan it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like at some point, you know, you wanna, uh, uh, a clever turn of phrase tends to be the big headline and then, excuse me. Um, and then we&#8217;ve got that little. Paragraph underneath. So some of this could get ex extended. Um, the other thing we can do since the world, this is the world we live in now. Uh, we open up chat g p t and we say generate 10.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whoever we&#8217;re ways to summarize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following</p>\n\n\n\n<p>right. 10 clever taglines. To summarize the following statements,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should have shared my screen for people who are not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, uh, have not played with chat G p T.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:18] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> you know what? It&#8217;s not on here. It&#8217;s over here, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:23] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Oh, there you go. It&#8217;s notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So professionalism at your fingertips. Images that speak a thousand words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Professionalism made easy. Anyway, these are all good phrases to play with. Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:02] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> something about your image matters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:05] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Hmm,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stumped chat. G p t</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:27] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> right here. I like this one. Turn your content into captivating social images. Yep. Right there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:35] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Oh my word. Oh my word. All right, so then I</p>\n\n\n\n<p>said rewrite them with using puns or light humor. And so version two, humor. You ready for this? I actually really like these. Don&#8217;t let your social media be a blur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website, feeling math, spice it up with professional social images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You just tell it to be funny. Yeah. I said, well, I said Add, add a pun or light humor. Words are great. Images are greater. That&#8217;s honestly fantastic. Yeah. Like it&#8217;s, I mean, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not funny, but it&#8217;s Right. The kind of</p>\n\n\n\n<p>like, to me, words are great, but images are greater as the, the big headline in the hero area. And then below that it&#8217;s saying something like, Use your word, you know, turn your WordPress content into valuable, shareable, professional images,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>easily create professional images from your,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>because I, yeah, I, one of the concepts that came up right is I, I really like the idea of. You&#8217;ve already done the work, and this is what we&#8217;ve been talking about since Crop Express, which is you&#8217;ve, you&#8217;ve set up a website, great. You&#8217;ve written a blog post. Great. That&#8217;s a lot of work. That&#8217;s a lot of effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of thought. And, and how we, we jumped from Crop Express to OMG is the idea of how do you, how do you not only, um, Make a featured image more compelling, but how do you take the content that you&#8217;ve already written, the work you&#8217;ve already done to add more value? And how do you make an image, um, what do I wanna say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Direct? Um, share that value, you know, immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:13] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> You, you created content for your WordPress website. Now you need a package and showcase it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Mm-hmm. Or showcase it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let your images do the talking. Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>winners there, our words are great, but images are greater. And let your images do the talking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, you and your problem statements. I love that. I never think to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:29] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s our. I love how we do this. So problem is you create content on your WordPress website. Now you want to showcase it, make it shine. The problem is you have to go outta WordPress, you have to do all these, you have to have all these other tools&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:49] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> and</p>\n\n\n\n<p>uh, common featured images. Don&#8217;t</p>\n\n\n\n<p>tell the content. Ooh, what do you wanna say by themselves?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They often are just a nice image and you rely on. The headline or bullet points or quote elsewhere to draw the user in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:39] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So you created the content. Now make it sizzle, sparkle, shine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:44] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I keep talking about the loop and I, I keep coming back to that and I don&#8217;t still don&#8217;t know how to explain that, but it&#8217;s the, like, you create, you create words that are compelling. You find an image that&#8217;s compelling, but the, the problem as it exists now for most websites is if you share a blog post, there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s an image that&#8217;s compelling, but it doesn&#8217;t have any of the words in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you&#8217;re relying on the headline and an excerpt. You know, you&#8217;re relying on Facebook to, to present the whole thing. And if somebody just sees an image or fails to skim the little bit, the little bitty headline under the image, they&#8217;re not gonna, they only get half the half the compellingness of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s like taking, taking your content and, and combining it with your featured image. It&#8217;s like one plus one equals three kind of situation where it&#8217;s like adding a big fold headline on top of that&#8217;s compelling, on top of a featured image that&#8217;s compelling, is more compelling than just sharing the image and the headline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you create&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:14] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> a content, now you wanna make it shine. Problem is you have to go outta WordPress. You have workflow one. Uh, the internal WordPress stuff doesn&#8217;t really sell the content. Plus they should, they should help entice images, should help entice people summarize and entice something like to get &#8217;em back to the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:45] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typing, boring, featured, featured images don&#8217;t create intrigue. They don&#8217;t sell the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t captivate the imagination. That&#8217;s not the right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t. Spark the imagination. Something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:26] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> the problem is it goes outta your workload. Boring featured images or afterthoughts Plus, they should make it. They should. They should be&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:35] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> enticing. Yeah. It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s lots of different ways that an image can. Add value. And I know like we are, we might be thinking about it more deeply than people often do, but I think maybe that&#8217;s the point, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like a lot of the time now people like you&#8217;ll see a, if I go to Medium and I see an article about writing code, there&#8217;s some clip art of. A person behind a laptop or of a robot, and it&#8217;s like, then, then why even have the image? And I know why, like human image, human brains are wired to be attracted to images, but, but there&#8217;s no value added there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just you&#8217;re just checking a box. And that&#8217;s heartbreaking. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p>there&#8217;s our three&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:37] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> features. Stay in your workflow? No more boring afterthoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:45] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Wow. Yeah. Wow. Who canice people to click?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re somewhere here. We&#8217;re we&#8217;re in the range. Yep. We&#8217;ll&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:05] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> work on the features next, but. Stay in your workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something here. No more boring afterthought, smell images. Stale, boring, stale, afterthought. Like there&#8217;s probably something here we can refine. It&#8217;s like put, put your images to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something to the effect of like, Born and still is opposite. Active, helpful prompting is better. Like that&#8217;s where we come in with the, uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>because we&#8217;re trying to show &#8217;em a vision of what could be better. Like right now it&#8217;s just boring. They&#8217;re afterthoughts,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>but you could transform that to help. That&#8217;s where we go. Sell the sizzle or shine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:07] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yep. Make your&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:08] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> images shine. Make your content shine&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:14] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> fresh. En. Engaging. Engaging. Memorable, engaging,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relevant. Helpful. Ooh, helpful. That&#8217;s a good&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:36] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> word, is to keep all these words, because I think we&#8217;ll put a list of things. Oh, here it is. The before and&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:43] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> after. Nice. Yep. Nice. Yep. Morning. Thoughts. Still homogenized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, what, what&#8217;s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:01] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> the word for like, they&#8217;re just taking up&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:03] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> space. Checking a box. Placeholder. Placeholder. No more placeholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we Wow. You, you&#8217;ve seen those, uh, Home pages that have a, like a slider before and after. And on the left we show, you know, an image of a landscape and a, you know, 10 places to go camping. But as it&#8217;s presented in Facebook with just a big, big image that&#8217;s pretty, but it has no value. And the headline that has no treatment and then you swipe and it shows the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our treatment of the image with a background and, and, uh, a color treatment to it. And then a clever font or an interesting font and like, so we do a bunch of those where it&#8217;s like, here&#8217;s your boring placeholder, nothing. And here, even if we just, even if that&#8217;s all you give us, here&#8217;s, here&#8217;s how we make it Compelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compelling would love that before and after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:35] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I like this before, Hey, if there, this is a wishlist, not a, but If there was a sample, you know, it&#8217;s almost like, here&#8217;s your. Here&#8217;s your social graph before and, and paid a bar. He goes, pull the bar down. Transformation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:56] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Wow. Wow. Yes. Yeah. That was the kind of UI I was picturing. Like if you go to, they&#8217;re the, they&#8217;re the, the little web apps that are like, we&#8217;re moving a background or whatever, and you, and they have a slider and so you see the image and as you, you move a, move a bar, Back and forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so yeah, in our case, we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll have it, you might move the bar up and down or something, but that matches our logo. That&#8217;s amazing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:22] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> See and pull it down and we can share like a post status. We&#8217;ve got this, you know, we&#8217;re using this, so like before they, we looked at it sucks. Pull it down. Here it is like, yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done to showcase, make the content shine, entice people, comp compelling, I love that word compelling, you said. Mm-hmm. What? Boring to compelling. Boring To&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:49] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> compelling. Yeah. And again, I love the idea of, of valuable too. I put engaging. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it&#8217;s, yeah, we, we, we take, and it&#8217;s also, we take these pieces. And put them together. And that to me is where the value comes from. And it&#8217;s like, so even if, even if you only ever see it, just the image, you don&#8217;t see the headline because the headline can be in the image, then it, then there&#8217;s, um, the image itself, it&#8217;s more valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that&#8217;s not, that&#8217;s not the only use case. And it might not even be the most common use case, but like one of the things that. You talked about early on was, you know, creating slides essentially, or slide shows. And so being able to create images that have bullet points that summarize a post or quotes that summarize a quote, a post, you know, so there, there&#8217;s, there can actually, you know, if it&#8217;s um, if you interview somebody and they are really inspiring and you create a bunch of these images and you put them on your social media every [00:36:00] day, like, You are inspiring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could be inspiring people. So&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:05] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> it makes me think when you were saying that about the, I was trying to capture those again, even though we&#8217;ve done it a bunch. So like, can you see my little cursor here? Mm-hmm. In the copy, in the, uh, text editor part. It&#8217;d be awesome to have these. Oops, this touch, not that touch choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know what I&#8217;m talking about, like here, um, bullets. Numbers, check boxes, because when you said that 50 places to visit mm-hmm. Here&#8217;s 10 in their check boxes. Mm-hmm. The point is where I kind of default to, but I wonder if there&#8217;s a way to do so. Like the arrows.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:44] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Sure. Capture this back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You already know all this bullets. No, it&#8217;s I&#8217;m capture it. We need it captured.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:04] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Text boxes, numbers,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:09] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> emojis. Oh&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:10] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> God, you read my mind, but I didn&#8217;t wanna say it because I was like, I don&#8217;t wanna,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:15] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Hey, if we, if we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re starting a product with the OMG in the name, like we have to double down on the whole cute, uh, style, you know, emojis and butterflies. And&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:30] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I&#8217;ve been working with Lindsay on, on some of her work for my marketing assistant, and it did dawned on me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was like, it was. Uh, her personality is fun. Like she likes to have fun. Mm-hmm. And like, there&#8217;s, you&#8217;re not feeling fun here. And so it was like reintroducing that and I think mm-hmm. Uh, I&#8217;m gonna capture this too, is like, make&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:57] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> your content a party. Nice. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone wants to go to, Nah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that&#8217;s an advertising campaign right there, like a whole bunch of ads that are like, do people want to go to the we to your website? Make your website a party that everybody wants to get go to. That&#8217;s really fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. I&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:42] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> think we got a lot here. I think the benefits we can, we got enough to, like, we can put this back in chat, G B T two, but we just need three benefits and Yep. Um,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:56] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> which we ha we have four. I mean, you can always have more, but Yep. Stay within your workflow. Convert these. Well, and it&#8217;s, and we, and I think it&#8217;ll end up being, um, before and after is like the first big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we could do the three underneath of stay. Stay within your workflow, stay in the zone. Create more value, all those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is the technical term thingy</p>\n\n\n\n<p>stuff, stuff. It&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:45] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> makes me think, I&#8217;ve been doing the, uh, party emoticon, mo emoji. Mm-hmm. I&#8217;m like this little party thing. All&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:56] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right, now I&#8217;m just having fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might be the most, um, productive, midlife crisis anybody has ever had. Bless you, dude,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:09] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> about four to five years ago, this has been really timely. Saying, I&#8217;m outta it. I&#8217;m just saying&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:18] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I&#8217;ll take it now. We&#8217;ve learned to manage it anyway. Um, great test. Well, uh, homepages need testimonials, which we&#8217;ll add once we, uh, have them, the features can, we can fill out as we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:44] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, thanks for doing this. This is, I work best like this, planning off, you know, collaborating. Sure. So I appreciate this. Okay. See, do I have access to Omgm? I know I do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:05] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I don&#8217;t. Yes, you do. You have your, uh, Corey Miller account and then, um, so yeah, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s just Beaver Builder. So go drop in blocks or, um, or I can, and then the biggest thing, I mean like any of these websites, uh, Again, the, once the logo is locked down, and maybe we already have the colors, but we can use those colors to define what the, what the boxes on the page look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, um, the actual images always, usually takes me the longest of like, okay, you want screen, you want product screenshots. Go create the perfect product setup so that you can then take the perfect product screenshots. So, But I need to actually finish the damn thing. Wanna do&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:02] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> that? Cool. Dude, we&#8217;re flowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m starting to flow with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:13] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Well, and I&#8217;m, yeah, I&#8217;m, there&#8217;s been stuff that for me because I&#8217;m, this is how I work half the time anyway. Right? Like, I build and I rebuild, and I rebuild. And the whole time I&#8217;m thinking, and I&#8217;m, that&#8217;s why I keep trying to throw stuff at you or WeChat during the week, um, because it helps me redefine the product and, and wording and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s things that, like at one point we said, what do, what do we call it? And so in, in my mind, the, um, like the name of the company and the name of the product is O M G I M G. Um, which I kind of, it makes me giggle when it&#8217;s like people talk about like I B M or cvs and so it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s just way more letters, but it&#8217;s still like, sound it tongue in cheek in a tongue in cheek way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds very corporate cuz it&#8217;s a bunch of letters. Um, it,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:12] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> but if it makes you smile, that&#8217;s a really good thing, like Right. Hearing that it makes you smile too, because cvs, by the way, is my favorite story ever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:22] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Good man.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:22] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I&#8217;m anti Walgreens, our insurance. Ooh, seriously. I like Walgreens with the number two cvs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s clean like an Apple store for a pharmacy and I don&#8217;t know, tape some of them that&#8217;s clean. Uh, chips. Yep. Weird dehydrated products in the front anyway. Okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:47] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, I, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a sucker for those kinds of stores for sure. Uh, little bit of everything. I love a, do I love a good dollar store? Um, five below extremely dangerous for me to walk in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, dude,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:00] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> we, you and I should not go on five below&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:04] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> or we should. Um, but so the other thing that, um, I, uh, have been. It&#8217;s like, okay, so I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m not yet using the product, but as I&#8217;m building the product, I&#8217;m thinking about using it, et cetera. Right? And so, um, one of the other things that I realized I was doing was, so O M G I M G, name of the company, name of the product, um, OMG Images is the asset that it creates, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like, turn your, turn your image into an OMG image. And that&#8217;s where like when we did a demo whenever it was, Um, you know, a few, a few calls ago you were like, okay, change, change the buttons to say, you know, create new whatever it was. And I&#8217;m like, oh, okay. So, so in most of those places now, we, we are saying like, create a new i OMG image, or here is a list of your OMG images, because it&#8217;s basically any image that&#8217;s been enhanced by OMG img.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. And we are going to be OMG people because we&#8217;ve been also been enhanced by OMG I mg. This is&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:21] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> totally silly, but in the vein of creativity, ob absurd. Of course the t-shirt on the front might be OMG in the back is, I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s the silly thing. But I was like, I love this. The bar coming down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. Um, That thought. So like we&#8217;ll need that,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:43] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> that front. Oh, I, what I want is the, the T-shirt. I&#8217;m gonna stand up here some, the Panera, the T-shirt where the graphic is, the whole thing. And it&#8217;s going to be, it&#8217;s going to be omg, img, you know, but, but the whole front of the site or whole front of the, sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s huge bright colors. OMG img.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, when I was doing conbon, I wanted to be very clean and corporate because I was, I&#8217;m like, that&#8217;s, I think that&#8217;s gonna be my market. You know, it&#8217;s not fun and creative. It&#8217;s project management. Um, and eventually I, I started trying to, like a lot of, a lot of WordPress products have. Little critters, you know, little creatures, logos and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So eventually I introduced these very austere birds that I had designed, um, anyway, so at some point maybe we need something like that, but it&#8217;s like the, the conbon shirts were black polos with the little logo here and I did have it pretty big on the back cuz I&#8217;m like across word camp us. You need to be able to see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with this, we&#8217;re going the other action as big and as bold as possible, you know? Love it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:11] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. I don&#8217;t mind being&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:14] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> silly, right? Me neither. I. As&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:18] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> we have everybody listening going, uhhuh,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:20] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> duh. People like, yeah, that&#8217;s what I didn&#8217;t, I, I, I, what I should have said to chat G b t is take these 10 taglines and make dad jokes outta them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s see what we got. Um, but anyway, um, so yeah, we can sign off for today. I, I would task you with, um, Jump into the homepage if you&#8217;ve got time, you know, and or even just revise and finalize some of that wording. Um, maybe show it to Lindsay, see what she thinks. And cuz ideally by the time we get to that homepage, we are just plugging it in and going, oh, we need a new section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need a new product image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, I lost you. Can you hear me? Yes. Sorry, I lost you for a second. Yeah, I&#8217;m Panera&#8217;s they&#8217;re doing their lunch rush, so I think the wifi is starting to brown out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:24] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Ison broccoli, uh, chitter soup for me cuz that&#8217;s my favorite. All right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:30] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Thanks brother. Shout product, product placement. Uh, shout out to Panera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:35] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> yeah. Sponsored by Panera. Today everybody skips unlimited broccoli. Dip those chips in the broccoli cheese&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:42] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> soup. That&#8217;s a winner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:46] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Hey, let&#8217;s talk about working camps at some point. Um, probably in the next two weeks I&#8217;ll be ready to make some, uh, hotel arrangements&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:54] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> and stuff. Okay, great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:57] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Just it&#8217;s on my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not a priority. We&#8217;ll get it done. Um, but anyway, shaping up&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:03] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> plans for that. Yeah, I&#8217;ve got it sort of on the long list. I&#8217;m gonna be taking a train down, which will be fun. Oh, you&#8217;ve read my mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:12] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Ask you that. Oh, I wish I could do that here. I wish I could do that. We have Amtrak. It just takes 13 hours to get to Dallas, which like seriously, I&#8217;ve seen all of this part of Oklahoma in depth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:26] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;m sure. But yeah, everybody, uh, we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll start. This is, this is the first plug for, um, you know, O M G I M G is going to be, uh, revealed in many ways, uh, at Word Camp Pass with the brightest shirts you&#8217;ve ever seen.

We fear losing, we let red flags slide and when it’s bad, we still stick around and hope it gets better. We tell ourselves it’s the only option we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t imagine that there could be real fulfillment. We believe this is it: the 9 to 5, the endless grind. Work for the man and hope you end up with a retirement plan, at best. Hold on to that job &#8211; you never know how far and how hard you could fall without it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A space without hierarchy, a space where everyone has a voice, a space where inclusion and diversity are virtues seems like a smoke dream.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until you discover WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it went for me. Deep in the work, sleep, die cycle. Thinking this was it. I kissed my dreams goodbye, succumbed to being a slave to my paycheck because after all, I have a family to feed. Priorities, Amy. Priorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Discovering WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you aren’t even looking and you trip over something, not knowing what you’ve stumbled into. Then suddenly five years have passed and you have lasting friendships and a whole a$$ career. Your kids are fed, your bills are paid and you are happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s how it happened for me. I did what I had to, grabbed what job I could, worked hard and then got shoved face first into the lap of WordPress, without a clue what I was getting into. Without a clue that my life had just changed. I was actually quite angry. I was supposed to be promoted from my wildly underpaid tech support job to a wildly underpaid live chat supervisor job. How DARE they change their minds and pigeonhole me as a WordPress Tech!!?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the reality unfolded rather quickly after that. That when it comes to WordPress, there are only green flags. There is only a match in values. There is only a world where people&#8217;s human needs are met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The need for community, the need to be part of something bigger than you, the need for connection, the need to learn, to grow, to watch something else grow. The need for one step to lead to the next, where paths are abundant and there are no dead ends. I had no idea what I had just been shoved into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I made the best of it. I helped form a new WordPress dedicated support team. I fixed websites, I trained other agents, I determined policies and practices, and I started going to WordPress.org team meetings. At first I thought that I was just supporting the endeavors of my employer, but the truth is, it was much more than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-finding-the-community\">Finding the Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My first meeting was with the Hosting team. I hopped on Zoom unaware that I would already know every face in the room. Unaware that I would be going to these meetings every week for the next five years. Unaware that I’d become a Team Rep and get my fingerprints all over the Open Source Project. Unaware that I would find friends, learn so much, build skills and be offered jobs. Unaware that there were 30,000 people on the other end of the keyboard, and 400 million opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stayed in that job for years, and I extended myself way beyond my technical support role. I had ideas for how to support WordPress users and brought them to the leadership team. They were interested, though not completely onboard, but still gave me the greenlight to go ahead and try.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started offering developer services to their enterprise WordPress customers, instead of turning them away saying “we don’t do that here”. The customers were into it. They wanted and they needed that type of support. I stumbled upon more and more customers that needed developer help and offered them that help. I got my teammates involved. We were seeing results and the results were good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy customers, new streams of revenue and increased customer retention. Instead of being angry and at a loss, tech support customers had real options for resolution. They were willing to pay extra and they kept coming back for more. They praised us and our work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The VP of product and the CEO started noticing. They decided to mentor me and trained me in product development, agile software development and leadership. I started to flush out user journeys, product packages and made a two-year strategy for the growth of the developer service that is now a full blown product offering. After the first year they had me do a win loss report, and we found that the service had earned revenue just through word of mouth, before it was even established. Boom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet I was struggling to buy food. I was living under the poverty line. I was being praised, but not paid. Business owners take heed, this is how you lose good employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was a tech support agent who was helping run a team, fixing customer problems, developing a product, pushing code, creating business strategies and making revenue for the org. All while starving. All while witnessing my developer friends at the same company make six figures. I became disgruntled, I became more vocal about it, and I lost the favor of leadership by complaining &#8211; despite the fact that my complaints were valid. Lesson learned. After a while, I was just too unhappy with what I was paid for my numerous roles and quit out of frustration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had no idea what was going to happen next. I started studying code and blogging. I was elected into a Team Rep position on the WordPress Open Source Project. I practiced making WordPress themes and plug-ins. I learned Symfony, I learned some Javascript and Python, I learned how to have faith in myself and how to acquire clients outside of the stream of tech support. I became a Meetups organizer and got involved in WordCamps. I started sharing skills that I had learned and had used to survive in the tech field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I never wanted to be a freelancer or a web developer though. I actually prefer doing system administration over web development &#8211; so I kept looking for a full-time gig. After a few months, I landed a job as a WordPress Tech Lead. I got to work with design and development and build out pipelines, work with servers, clients and code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then Covid happened, and I think everyone can agree what a nightmare that was. I got hit with the first strain of Covid and was so, so sick. I couldn’t move for three months. I lost my job and I was too sick to care. I was blessed that my colleagues in the WordPress community cared, though. They supported me and some of them even prayed for my recovery. One of my hosting teammates suggested applying to a job with his employer. I said “alright whatever”, found an easy tech-support role that I definitely could do and applied.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They interviewed me and turned me away, saying I was overqualified. Bummer. Then a few weeks later, I got a phone call from them offering me an interview for a different position. A job as a Web Development Manager. I liked the idea despite my wicked imposter syndrome, and after some rounds of interviews, they offered me the job. I was there for two years and I loved my team. I was working with designers and developers, leadership and marketers. I got to work with servers, various tech stacks, DevOps pipelines, design systems, accessibility and SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, I was recruited into a Solutions Architect position. Then I was recruited again for a Developer role. I didn’t apply anywhere, I wasn’t looking and all I did was work hard, invest in my skills, be open to options and oh yeah &#8211; get involved with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I keep picking up clients and I have more work than I can realistically handle. I’m going to have to start hiring other people to help me out soon. Maybe I&#8217;ll file for an LLC and take all that knowledge and experience, all that momentum and roll it up into one big future as a boss lady. Bring the WordPress values I feel so aligned with to the table on MY terms. The tech industry needs more boss ladies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t honestly know what’s coming next, but I know I don’t need to worry because I have the right community, the right skills, the right resources and endless opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All because of one little package of code. All because of the amazing people behind it. All because of WordPress.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/because-of-wordpress/\">Because of WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Jun 2023 12:37:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Amy Kamala\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"Post Status: Improving Visa Support • Event Tooling • WP-CLI Updates • Block Inspector Sub-groups\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=149581\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://poststatus.com/improving-visa-support-event-tooling-wp-cli-updates-block-inspector-sub-groups/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20116:\"<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-april-3-2023\">This Week at WordPress.org (June 5, 2023)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Community team is considering tooling around the building and using the WordCamp websites, in addition to the naming of events.

Apple&#8217;s previously favorite (app of the year!) journaling app was <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com/\">Day One</a>, one of <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic&#8217;s</a> products, but they <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23738869/apple-journal-app-ios-iphone-wwdc-2023\">announced their own Journal app</a>. One nice thing about competing with Apple is they only really interoperate with their own devices, and they&#8217;re usually not good at social. Day One is launching Shared Journals soon, a social feature so you can have fully end-to-end encrypted shared private journals with friends and family. It&#8217;s been the thing I&#8217;ve been most excited about since we bought the app. (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulmayne\">Paul</a> can attest how much I ask him about it!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That complements <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com/blog/apples-journal-app-and-day-ones-evolution/\">another advantage Day One has</a>, which is being cross-platform. If you have a family member on Android, you don&#8217;t want to ostracize them from your Shared Journal. Apple doesn&#8217;t care, their priority is getting everyone on the Apple ecosystem. You care, and Day One/Automattic does too, that&#8217;s why it works great on all Apple devices, Android devices, and the web itself.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Jun 2023 20:47:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"Do The Woo Community: Blocks, Full-site Editing, Performance and more DevChat with Sean Conklin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=75271\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-developer-chat-sean-conklin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:405:\"<p>Carl, Zach and Sean cover a lot of WooCommerce developer ground in this show.

Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro music)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of this year, there has been a lot of research and examination of the contributor funnel in the WordPress community. That research confirms some assumptions about what most contributor stories have in common: the hurdles, the general paths taken, and the way that problem-solving was done. Then in February of this year, Hari Shanker published a proposal for a mentorship program for WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we&#8217;ve got a pilot program that&#8217;s been defined and is waiting for your feedback. If you&#8217;ve not read the post about the contributor mentorship program, for one do it. But if you would rather hear a synopsis from me, don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m about to give you a 10-cent tour.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:22]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, who is doing this? This pilot program has been outlined by a community working group. We often have working groups in WordPress, and they almost always have specific projects around events or programs, or code updates. Since this working group is focused on a project-wide program, there is project-wide representation in it. All the names are at the bottom of the post, which you can find in our show notes. But it&#8217;s got folks who contribute with code or contribute with time or contribute with design folks who are self-sponsored or corporately sponsored, just a nice mix of people. The program as a whole, though, is being stewarded by Hari Shankar, a longtime supporter of and contributor to WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:06]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So next, what is this for? There are a few goals for the program. But the overarching goal is to increase the success of new contributors over time. We can all agree that if we were to have 1000s of new contributors every day, but they couldn&#8217;t find their way to impactful contributions or meaningful connections quickly, then we would have done them a disservice. And they probably won&#8217;t continue to be part of the community without a bit more effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The when and the where are essentially “right now and right here,” so that brings us finally to Why. Why are we doing this mentorship program? Apart from to help people who want to contribute have an easier path to success – which frankly is enough of a reason anyway – the why is wrapped up in our overall philosophies in the project. If we believe that good ideas can come from anywhere and that contributions of any size matter. And that open source is an idea that can change our generation and that we are democratizing publishing, then bringing new people brings new ideas, and beginner contributions can grow over time. We can maintain this idea, this concept of open source, into the next generation and to future generations. And always keep our sights on the open web. To learn more about this and other project-wide initiatives, swing by make.wordpress.org/project or check the links in today&#8217;s show notes on wordpress.org/news/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:53]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:56]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First on the list is WordCamp Europe. That&#8217;s coming up at the end of the week on June 8 through 10th in Athens, Greece. There will be a major update from Matt and friends, so even if you aren&#8217;t there in person, keep an eye out for those recordings. But for those who are there and you&#8217;re curious about the mentorship program or anything else to do with WordPress and contributing to the project, you can come find me or Angela Jin, Hari will also be there, Chloé will be there, Héctor will be there, lots of people, and we want to hear your thoughts and answer your questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is a call for brainpower! A call for your brainstorms! On the subject of the next generation, we&#8217;ve got a discussion going on about the next generation of WordCamps. We&#8217;ve been discussing what new types and varieties might be available, and that might make sense for people as we get back to in-person events. So if you&#8217;ve got a kind of WordCamp that you&#8217;ve been desperately wanting to try, now&#8217;s the time to let folks know about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:54]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is the second volume of The WordPress history book called Building Blocks: The Evolution of WordPress is now available for download in several formats as well as on GitHub.

How it’s possible to create themes inside the editor, and how you can do this without needing to know much code. We talk about the fact that, if you’re a coding expert, you could always create complex themes, but this fresh approach opens up the possibilities for those with less technical backgrounds. The experience in the editor might not be exactly what everyone wants, but it’s evolving quickly and maturing with every new release of WordPress.&#8221; It&#8217;s definitely worth listening to, and checking out the resources shared. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>For the third part of the Twitch Stream series <em>Building a developer-focus block theme</em>, <strong>Ryan Welcher</strong> teamed up with <strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> to take a deep dive of theme.json and block theme development. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6tqqlBVvo&t=1s\"><strong>Building a developer-focus block theme.

Felt explains the workflow on the <a href=\"https://github.com/happyprime/wphtml-converter\">GitHub repo</a>: &#8220;When first building a template of blocks to be used as part of a block variation or other template, it is useful to do this work in the block editor. When adding the template to JavaScript in an&nbsp;<code>innerBlocks</code>&nbsp;property, it needs to be formatted differently and again differently when reusing it in PHP. As your templates get more complicated, so does this translation—when done manually.&#8221; Hence, the Converter tool. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/need-a-zip-from-master/\">Need a plugin .zip from Gutenberg&#8217;s master branch?</a></strong><br />Gutenberg Times provides daily build for testing and review. <br />Have you been using it?

They explore the use of Open Graph (OG) images, social media platforms, and the importance of consistent branding. They mention the need for a logo and discuss the design concept, leaning towards a fun and vibrant style. They also touch on website development, pricing, and marketing assets. The conversation revolves around simplifying the image generation process and creating a user-friendly product. Overall, they aim to finalize the project&#8217;s features, branding, and logo to move forward with the launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Logo and Branding: </strong>The importance of creating a logo and establishing a consistent branding for your project. You want a logo that represents image generation in a fun and vibrant way, potentially incorporating bright colors and a big, fun font. It should look good on different merchandise items like t-shirts and baseball caps.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Image Generation and Sharing:</strong> The main focus of your project is image generation and sharing. Using a logo generation tool and exploring concepts related to image generation, sharing, and open graph images. The goal is to make the process of generating and sharing images easy and efficient for users.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Project Progress: </strong>The progress of the project, including bug fixes and updates. The plan is to address the bugs and implement additional features and improvements. Once the sitewide and post-level functionalities are handled, the project will be ready to share with others. Defining the project&#8217;s style, including the logo and overall branding, is an important next step</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://crop.express/\">Crop.Express</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\">Post Status</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/\">WP Beginner</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fiverr.com/\">Fiverr</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://makelogo.ai/\">MakeLogo.ai</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/vovafeldman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Vova Feldman</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/syedbalkhi\">Syed Balkhi</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://ogp.me/\">Open Graph Image</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-you-can-follow-post-status-and-our-guests-on-twitter\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f426.png\" alt=\"🐦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-wrapper\">\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/coreymaass\">Corey Maass</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> (CEO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\">Olivia Bisset</a> (Intern, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper has-background\">The <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4dd.png\" alt=\"📝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Browse our archives</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe via <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simplecast</a>, or <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Session 15 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>C&amp;C 15</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> All right. Hold on before we go live. Okay. Um, what&#8217;s on your mind&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:21] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> today to talk about? It looks like you&#8217;re streaming to YouTube, but I&#8217;m not recording.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:33] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> Okay, I&#8217;ll just push record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey everybody. Welcome back to Corey and Corey on launching a product lot has been happening in the background. Mainly Corey&#8217;s been on a manic work streak, but we have a working version of the plugin on post edit and uh, he gave me a walkthrough yesterday setting stuff. Corey, what are we, what&#8217;s on your mind today to talk, talk about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:03] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Uh, I think we are, uh, getting close to the first milestone of actually having a product that you, you specifically could start using. My clients could start using maybe, um, I&#8217;m gonna install it on all of my websites. Um, But I think we can start. I&#8217;ve got a, after the installing it on post status yesterday, which we chose not to do live, which worked out just fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but we&#8217;ve got a, a pretty slick little product, um, a short punch list of bugs to fix that I&#8217;m working on, um, over the next couple of days. Um, But I think we could start pivoting to how we&#8217;re gonna present this publicly. Um, you know, start setting up the marketing site. I&#8217;ve got the e-commerce set up. I think it works to actually take money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven&#8217;t tried that yet, but that&#8217;s okay. Um, so yeah, I think it&#8217;s the, the next steps to talk about here now are, you know, what we need. So, I mean, for us, but also talking abstractly about. You know, once you have a product, uh, what do you do? So&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:33] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> yeah, with the product, we&#8217;re in this interesting phase, which is working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s working. When we put it up on a live site, yesterday, we were both making notes about where the product is. But I, I still go back to, I think this is so valuable. Me putting on the client customer hat and actually using it. And more so than I think any product I&#8217;ve had before is really using it and thinking about it creatively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How I want those things to come out, I think is gonna formulate back to products. So, so while it already has like our initial OG image, open graph image for site wide. We did some reviews in the past episode. Um, I did some work and I, I really saw some patterns in the synthesis. Mm-hmm. What, like, it is gonna go do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you, you were like almost simultaneously building it, which is awesome. Um, I gotta tell you from yesterday, um, we got, we got some polish that we, we know we&#8217;ve been working on, um, that you even saw and were like, oh, we need this. Um, I love your openness again about hearing feedback and, Hmm, before using it just shows how good of a data of an entrepreneur you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the, the one I&#8217;m really eager to is getting to the blog posts because for this product, uh, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s more so than just an open graph image. It&#8217;s like a social image to share with the post to make it compelling. I think all that work we did with Crop Express, So it&#8217;s all good. Mm-hmm. Helped, like think through what we&#8217;re doing now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I, I got giddy, you know, that I did some of the work when we did the pattern for the home, home or site default. Uh, I went on with some of the blog posts and I was like, this right&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> here is the money. Yep. Yeah. I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m with you. I think I, one of the. Pivotal moments for us with crop.express was you said, you know, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m mental octopus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m all over the place, you know? Yeah. Over here we do this and then we could do this, but it could do this, and over here it&#8217;ll do this and, and you&#8217;re like, what if we start with the feature image? I was like, that&#8217;s. You know, brilliant dart to the center of the dart board kind of thing. Um, and so with this, I really liked you, you did essentially the same thing where you&#8217;re like, OG image for the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was an easy lift for me to add that. So on activation, the plugin takes you to a little welcome screen, which doesn&#8217;t look pretty yet, but that&#8217;s fine. You upload a logo and you click a button and your site has an OG image. And so we are, I love that you install the plugin and a handful of clicks and we are offering value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are taking it already to um, Bringing, bringing your site. You know, we keep de debating about how we actually do this wording, um, but, or, or how we word this. But, you know, within a few clicks, our plugin makes your website more professional. Um, if you&#8217;ve got Yost installed, maybe you&#8217;ve already got an OG image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t, we provide one, um, and our plugin will override. The image. So it&#8217;s like whatever you&#8217;ve done in Canva or elsewhere, you know, you can update, you can update regularly, that kind of thing. Um, so yeah, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m with you. We&#8217;re, we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve reached that minimum viable product mentality in that we are immediately offering value, which I think is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then, The next, next thing following that OG image thread is, yeah, for each blog post, for each product, um, figuring, you know, again, initially it&#8217;ll be a, uh, a manual process of like, oh, you&#8217;re, you know, essentially for every blog post you, you are adding going forward, um, Once you&#8217;ve set up the blog post, you then can go set up your OG image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so we get there and that, that honestly is about 60%, 70% of the cleanup I need to do anyway. I. We are product complete, we are ready to sell a product. Um, and then, yeah, down the road, uh, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s obviously lots of fun and, and interesting things. One, you know, like I wanna be able to, we&#8217;ve talked about, but I wanna be able to, like for you on post status, you&#8217;ve got, you know, dozens or hundreds of posts that already exist and so they will benefit from the Sitewide OG image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if you set up a template for a stand, you know, a template that goes with a blog post and click a button and it retroactively goes back and creates OG images for each of those blog posts, stuff like [00:08:00] that. Um, but I kind of think that that&#8217;s one that&#8217;s neat. You know, that&#8217;s icing on the cake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a version 1.1 kind of feature. Um, but also I, I do think we want a little bit of validation. Before that happens. Um, and or if we find ourselves twiddling our thumbs and you&#8217;re like, yeah, for post status, I we really need this, then we can call that validation and I can implement it. But, um, but yeah, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s flushing out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being featured complete as far as OG images is, is the way to start. And obviously right along with that, it&#8217;s easy enough to create, um, a duplicate image that is square so you can throw it on Instagram or whatever. Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>behind the scenes, I think what&#8217;s really cool is. We kept, but after doing the, the first install yesterday on post status, Corey set up a first basic OG image. And then due to caching, we couldn&#8217;t see it. We could verify that it was there by viewing the source. And we knew the image was there, but we couldn&#8217;t see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just now during our call, uh, Basically what&#8217;s funny is our Slack, private Slack conversation is just us posting post status.com back and forth, back and forth, trying to see the damn thing work and uh, Corey just posted it and adjusted it did just show up and that is one of the most satisfying things ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, it&#8217;s working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:48] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> Absolutely. I do think if I just put on the post status as a customer hat, Um, we do a fair amount of content and we want to, we have a significant following on Twitter and in, uh, LinkedIn and I particularly camp out on LinkedIn for a second. It&#8217;s really compelling to me and, and I, a couple years ago, I kind of, okay, I&#8217;ve just accepted invitations over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I&#8217;m gonna see what this is about. I, I really think, especially with Twitter&#8217;s implosion, There&#8217;s a real value back to LinkedIn. Um, even more so than was there. But when I think about post customer for a second, we do a piece of content. We could just do the typical thing, copy, link, paste into Instagram, put a couple of words in it, do that thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I think there&#8217;s value though, that image of like, I was just thinking like we do these weekly roundups with tech and business and like, or make wordpress.com for instance, or make WordPress, um, having like just the headlines. Mm-hmm. You know, like weekly roundup is the tech roundup and then there&#8217;s three or four bullets of like what goes into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they&#8217;d know a preview of like, oh, I&#8217;m interested, I&#8217;m gonna click through, go to the link. That&#8217;s valuable to me because right now I&#8217;m just gonna take a link post in there. Hope the featured image looks decent, cuz it always pulls that. So, like, to me that&#8217;s value for, for post status. Client hat is like, it&#8217;s just right there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I can take a couple steps while I&#8217;m in the post. When I get it done is when I usually put it over there. And now somebody, somebody might schedule that, that&#8217;s cool. However, I kinda like post share it. Sure. Uh, and having that right there with like, I keep going back to my slide content slides I&#8217;ve done for talks and do different things and you know, some header with wall points and, and I think what I worked on the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Image templates that you also mentioned was like holding in an actual image to that. Right. That&#8217;s always capture thought to me. But if it&#8217;s there, pulled in, adds a little visual pair pto where it&#8217;s just not like a slide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:20] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. We&#8217;re gonna, it&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s all these, from a text standpoint, there&#8217;s these, these loops that, or these circles we&#8217;re gonna want to close.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Because it&#8217;s the, and, and we&#8217;re gonna have to think through the, the workflow, the UI for this, um, which, and it might be as simple as a button, but there might be some setup beforehand. So, we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll have to walk through this, but it&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s why I tried to wa I tried to talk this all out. I, I don&#8217;t know, two or three calls ago where I was like, okay, the first step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just a minute ago, in fact, the first step is the OG image. For the site. The second step is the OG image per post, which you&#8217;re gonna have to set up manually. Fine. Like we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re building a product. The, uh, one of the, the circles that I want to close for you and for, for the product pretty quickly is you, you&#8217;ve created a blog post or, again, I, I want to keep harping on product too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither of us are in e-commerce. Particularly, but I, I think this is gonna be a lot of value. Um, but whatever it is, a post of some kind, you up upload a featured image. That featured image gets used in an OMG I M G, an OMG image. We&#8217;ll call &#8217;em that. And then a, and then there&#8217;s an option to replace the featured image, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like you&#8217;ve uploaded a temporary featured image that then gets incorporated into a template. And generated as an an OMG image that then replaces the featured image so that the, essentially the headline on the blog post, wherever, however the featured image was used, which like you said, a lot of the time when you share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The featured image comes up and I, I, there&#8217;s going to be instances where an OG image is almost moot because the featured image works has two purposes. One is as a featured image, like if you&#8217;re looking at a blog post, and the second is if somebody shares it. You know, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn will automatically pull in the first image, usually the featured image, which will be, which will act as the OG image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, so it&#8217;s one asset, multiple purposes. Um, but in both instances, I think that there&#8217;s, you know, when we were first really exploring this, we went and looked at, um, WP Beginner, I think we looked at, um, Prius&#8217;s blog and, and we saw that a bunch of them, or the two, I think the two of those, and a and a bunch of other sites, the featured image, it was almost redundant, but the featured image itself was s shareable because it had the blog post title and stuff in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I liked what you said a minute ago of like, often, right now you upload a featured image of. You know, business person at laptop looking businessy, you know, it&#8217;s, you know, and it might be a photo of, of somebody. But, but then you go and you share it and you hope that it&#8217;s relevant and you hope that the people will see a title that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s, you know, links the image to the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re talking about is, um, Yeah, is inserting, inserting the title right into the image. So again, it might end up being a little, it might feel redundant, or as you&#8217;re doing the workflow, it feels redundant, but you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re guaranteeing that every image has more value. Um, and then, yeah, here you&#8217;re illustrating the second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Loop that we wanna close, which again, feels kind of meta, but it&#8217;s the like, create a blog post, take a picture of the blog post, pull that that picture in, um, to an, an OMG image, and then use that to share, or even as the featured image. So you&#8217;re gonna end up with, and in theory if you do this, uh, A couple if you, if you create a template using the featured image or create an OMG image using the featured image, and then take a picture of it, you could end up with, you know, a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture all the way down, which is kind of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway. Um, But I think that that&#8217;s, you know, we&#8217;re talking about value and, and a, one of the ways that we achieve value is information. So, headlines, excerpts, bullet points. The other way we, a, we add value is something com is, is by creating a compelling image. And I think at least right now, with the way or a current trend, That achieves, this is exactly what you&#8217;re showing, which is, um, an image of content, but in the context of a device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on a screen or, um, yeah, on a cell phone, on a desktop, that kind of thing. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:37] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> Was, uh, just looking at this for a second, thinking about when you&#8217;re saying the featured image, Is how, like I don&#8217;t mm-hmm. Feel like super, uh, energized by what I did here on these two. And I was like, okay, well, you know, when you go, like there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s two parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s the social value, we&#8217;ve already talked about that, but there&#8217;s the search value. Mm-hmm. The image is a piece of content that summarizes mm-hmm. Inspire someone to click through, but like almost go, like that&#8217;s thinking of it as a piece of content that is an image piece of content, but it has valuable stuff on here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and like it&#8217;s really that slide format is, you know, everybody takes a picture of really good presentations when they&#8217;ve got slides. Cause they&#8217;re like, this is cool. I don&#8217;t know what this is called in Google, Emmett Google search, Google Images, but, Makes me think when we get to this part, we need to have a caption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. Um, that when the image is out there, there&#8217;s a caption. It seems like, I don&#8217;t know what this is called within Google, the image side of things, but like, it&#8217;s an opportunity I haven&#8217;t seen really explored that I would mm-hmm. That I would like. You&#8217;re, you&#8217;re searching and those, that image side comes up too, um, where there&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting content summarized for you, like right there, right. Um, that&#8217;s really valuable. So I was trying to think like, okay, how would you really want that to look like if you don&#8217;t have a featured image, which is my problem easily. Um, you know, would we put, even if there&#8217;s, I I was just thinking about&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:33] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> that for a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I like the idea too of, um, And I hadn&#8217;t thought of this before, uh, essentially a default featured image like we are using a logo. So let&#8217;s, like for post status, you&#8217;ve got, you&#8217;ve got the little PS infinity symbol everywhere. Um, but also the ev I think a lot of people associate like the homepage of post status has that image of people at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the, the, you know, the post status conference years ago, um, that hasn&#8217;t changed in 10 years, excuse me. Um, but, uh, you know, but that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s now, it&#8217;s now it&#8217;s a bit of your branding, right? Like that&#8217;s now a photo that, that people might actually associate with post status. So if that was, um, if that was the standard featured I, the default featured image that got pulled in everywhere, you know, even if, like one of the things that we&#8217;ve talked about is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Image, uh, is, is tr image treatments. So it&#8217;s like as a ba if the background was two women chatting with that was, you know, converted to black and white and had, and had an orange filter over the top. And so it was just, again, these are, these are all of the things that humans find compelling, even if it&#8217;s not obvious or.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upfront or obtuse. Um, you know, having, having two eyes and a s and a smile is known to be compelling to humans at a subconscious level. So it&#8217;s stuff like that that, um, these little simple effects that we can start to explore down the road, or, I mean soon, sooner than later, but it&#8217;s like, as we&#8217;re going along, as we&#8217;re learning about this stuff, we can go, oh, right, let&#8217;s just add a default option for, you know, these background treatments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, just looking at seeing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:35] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> Mm-hmm. Some publications like, obviously these&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:38] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> are,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it&#8217;s interesting. Yeah. I mean these are, you know, most of these featured image as a background. Yeah. Title pulled in and selected. Put this at the top of the bottom, and some of them have an excerpt below the title. That&#8217;s the whole thing. You know, and so it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s up to the authors or you know, publishers since this is New York Times to find compelling images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I mean, and so un you know, we&#8217;ve talked about that at various points. That&#8217;s not a problem we&#8217;re choosing to solve right now. Um, so as the publisher of a given blog, you still have to go find that compelling image. But once you do, we give you all these options to do something with it. And what I really like is we&#8217;re defining a, a process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s once you, yeah, that&#8217;s the picture. Um, once you essentially define your style, So it&#8217;s like I, I, I&#8217;ve talked about, I&#8217;m a musician as a hobby, and I actually have a, a new track coming out tomorrow. And so I&#8217;ve put that on my band camp and, um, you know, for every track that I finish, every re you know, release that I do, I now go into Canva.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hit copy or duplicate from the last. Release image that I created. Yeah. And I changed the title, the text, and I changed the image. But that way the font is always the same. The font size is always the same. The colors, font, colors are always the same. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re talking about here is like you creating exactly what you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say this, you created this and saved this for a first blog post. The idea would be then to say, save this as the default. Blog post featured image template. So then you go into, you, you say word in WordPress, you say add new, you write a new blog post. When you jump in to OMG I M G, this is gonna come up first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want it, you know, right away create your, you know, A an OMG image from your saved default blog post OMG image template, and you say, yes. And it sucks in the headline, it sucks in the featured image and you might go in and tweak it a little bit. You know, like if the headline&#8217;s really long or it&#8217;s more fun to have like, just like you showed on that New York Times Instagram a second ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the image, you might want the title at the top or the bottom, but most of the work is done with you done for you. You tweak a couple of things, you know, move a couple of sliders and then you&#8217;re good. Um, I&#8217;m excited about that. I think that that&#8217;s gonna be neat. I think that it&#8217;s going to be, it&#8217;s one of those things that</p>\n\n\n\n<p>one of the challenges is going to be for, because it, because they are associated with publishing. It&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a hurry up and wait kind of product. That&#8217;s one of the only things, red flags that I have. So it&#8217;s like, if there&#8217;s a button for creating these images for all existing posts, that&#8217;s huge value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? But this is also one of those, like you install it. And then you have to go write a blog post. And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m really glad that we&#8217;re creating a sitewide OG image. We can create sitewide social images, you know? But if you don&#8217;t have, if you&#8217;re not gonna write a blog post until tomorrow, you don&#8217;t have a reason to use the plugin until tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we talked&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:32] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> about assigning. Mm-hmm. You could go back to a previous post. Mm-hmm. So I wonder if there&#8217;s a thought where we put a preview of a post, you know, To get &#8217;em started or&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:43] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> something. Mm, that&#8217;s awesome. So what I took,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:47] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> one of the big things I took for that is the fact that people do are in the rhythm of doing a featured image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I defaulted to these templates because I don&#8217;t. Mm-hmm. That&#8217;s my mindset. So I just was trying to play for a second. I go, I think these things still apply, you know? Oh, for sure. Image on left. Image on right image as background with opa. I was trying to find an opacity here, but, um, yeah, and then you want headline, like pin on the photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want it up here?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:18] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Right. You don&#8217;t want it, you wouldn&#8217;t want it to cover a person&#8217;s face, so you&#8217;d move it to the bottom left. But if the image has people on the bottom, then you want it at the top or whatever. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ve, you know, as I&#8217;ve been developing, so I, I did a, for anybody listening to this who didn&#8217;t watch the last one, go watch the last one. Um, because we did a, a little walkthrough, um, and, and showed my initial approach to the product specifically, we are not, Canva, we are not drag and drop like I and I at various points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the developer in me wants to take this to the obvious extreme. Um, and, and that in many respects is Canva, which is drag and drop and, and infinite options. And. And I think, I mean, part of that, it it part of, I don&#8217;t want to go down that path because it&#8217;s just a hell of a lot of work and I want to just get this damn thing out the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also do think objectively that I, at least for now, prefer this approach because of what we&#8217;re talking about. Like if you want to go, if you wanna be in Photoshop, be in Photoshop. If you don&#8217;t, if you&#8217;re, if that&#8217;s a bit too much. Go jump into Canva, get creative, go wild. But this is, to me is meant to be quick and dirty as underselling it, but you know, quick and useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just another step in your workflow. And that was, which is kind of the conclusion we came to out of Crop Express was like, you&#8217;ve got this workflow, here&#8217;s a pain point in your process, but it shouldn&#8217;t be the entire process. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:14] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> Well, just like playing with this, I go, okay, I get it. You know, put it in the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve got left and we&#8217;ll have a right version of all this stuff. Yeah. But there&#8217;s an option of like set featured image as background. Then they can play with the color options you&#8217;ve given them. And I mean, I call that pretty good. Yeah. If, if you&#8217;re in the, if you just want headline and photo. This is an option if you want, I think, which is gonna be even BA could be even better, is like there&#8217;s a piece of content, like&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:53] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Again, I think that that&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s version 1.2, right? Where we, you know, one of the things that got us really jazzed talking about this early on was you brought up slides. Um, we&#8217;ve talked a few times about, um, drop, uh, poll quotes, drop quotes, block quotes, whatever you call &#8217;em. And so, you know, I&#8217;m excited about, again, version 1.2 or whatever, where.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We actually have a little wizard that says like, here are the quotes from the page. Ah, and this is where we bring in ai and that&#8217;s why we, we make 2 million. Um, but, you know, throw this content at, at our integration with ai and it come and it comes back with three different bullet point summaries of the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we, as we automatically just drop that content in. There you go. We figured out the AI integration. I knew it was just a matter of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:10] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> I&#8217;m using in a service called podway. Test it out. Yep. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see how something like this&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:24] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> would look. Yep. Exactly. And this is where, again, like once, once a, once a template is defined, cuz these are all placeholders, right? So you&#8217;ve got a placeholder for the photo, the, the, the image of. The content, you&#8217;ve got a placeholder for the title, and then you&#8217;ve got a placeholder for a three bullet point summary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now either you can write that summary or again, we could have something write it for you, or you could have something write it for you. Um, but I love the idea. So one of the things that, so I&#8217;ve been playing with chat g p t, like everybody else for one of my products. I went into chatGPT, and I said, Write 20, um, 20 tweets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Broadly speaking, you know, for the topic of my product. And then I said, write 20 tweets that target creatives. Specific to my product and then business people, you know? And so it was very similar content, but slightly different. And so in the end, instead of 20 tweets over and over again, I wound up with 60 tweets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I scheduled them one a day. Right. And so I&#8217;m picturing something very similar here where it&#8217;s like, you know, If you, if you had your featured image for the, for the, you know, the, the one you&#8217;re doing in right in front of us, you&#8217;ve got three bullet points. You&#8217;ve got a title, you&#8217;ve got a featured image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. But like this is just one and. In, in our world now, you can&#8217;t, you&#8217;re never going to, or you shouldn&#8217;t, uh, just tweet about something once. You don&#8217;t write a blog post, tweet about it, and then forget about it. You need a long tail of content to be able to share, right? And so ideally, Not only would you say generate, like, say if this, what&#8217;s in front of us right now is, is your, you know, saved template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only would you say generate this, but you would say, generate five variations of this. And you, I, this is again where I think I AI is a perfect candidate. You&#8217;d say, you know, Hey, chatGpT, here&#8217;s my article. Summarize it. With three bullet points in five different ways, and then we suck all that in. And then picture a page that just has this template with the different content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, so there&#8217;s six versions right down, and you, and you go, which ones do you wanted to use? Bang, bang, bang. Save them all, you know, and then schedule them all. And that way, and you&#8217;ve got one that goes out each day or you do two days, four days, eight days. 16 days. So again, you get this long tail of content that isn&#8217;t identical but is all relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s gonna be huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Assuming that people are actually promoting their content the way they&#8217;re supposed to. Right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:33] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> Which is, is is part of the challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:37] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. I think that I, you know, your emphasis we&#8217;re on call 15, right? So your emphasis throughout all of our conversations on agencies and on professionals, teams, et cetera, while it&#8217;s not, I&#8217;m very much like the solopreneur in entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever other funny way you wanna say the preneur word. Um, but I think small, I build small products for myself and so other people in my shoes. And it&#8217;s not at all that I won&#8217;t use this, but again, I, you know, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m working with clients that have dedicated social media managers. They&#8217;re the target agencies that are doing full-blown marketing campaigns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re the, they&#8217;re the target because again, it&#8217;s these, this long tail of content that that&#8217;s going to require variation, that are going to benefit the most from this. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:49] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> Yeah. I&#8217;ve been thinking really much in that regard as like, okay, what would I want? How do I, it&#8217;s like, This slide for that post, you know, something like this, like a treatment over here doesn&#8217;t take up too much space for the the brand, but at least brands it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. This is a post status thing, and then this is really informative content like mm-hmm. It&#8217;s really that summary. Too long, didn&#8217;t read. Yeah. Take this for any post. It&#8217;s like you said, you can throw that into Chatgpt and get a bunch of these things, but like, yeah. I don&#8217;t know if I worked on something like that, but I go, this case study warrants a lot like headline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a roundup we do about what&#8217;s happening in WordPress core based. Basically, she has these every, every week. These are the things you would just pull from it. Three things you need to know. Have chat. ChatGPT, help you with that if you want, and then to put it here and then you go, okay. What I would normally do is say, save this as an image, and I&#8217;d go over to what if I should do that real quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, there we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay right there. I need to work on the image, image size, of course, but then you&#8217;re just putting in alt text. I dunno why the logo didn&#8217;t show up. Oh, it&#8217;s right there. So you know, if you think about it, right there. You&#8217;re okay. You&#8217;re, you&#8217;re a member of Post, so select the idea is you can look at this and see it a glance, some of the things going mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then decide to click on. That&#8217;s value for the social right there. We&#8217;ve already mm-hmm. We&#8217;ve already talked about that, I think, but I think philosophically, I&#8217;m shaping this a little bit up and my mind is, it&#8217;s the too long, didn&#8217;t read now. Mm-hmm. You get this and whatever this. Uh, Google image. Like what would be example where if I, here, lemme see how to change a light pole, light switch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something. You, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Like this, people also ask, there&#8217;s some, uh, search criteria. They come like this, you know, the video content that shows up. There&#8217;s sometimes, I guess it&#8217;s more pinteresty type stuff like,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like of a better word, video show up. But isn&#8217;t there a section where images show up sometimes?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:08] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. Search for a product, search for, um, say like that. So, um, there you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like in shopping is what I found. Okay. This one. So now hold on, hold on. Um, click and start dragging one of those images like this. Yeah. Did it? Yeah. I just discovered this this morning. So you can drag an image into Google Lens to do, uh, to find out more meta information about. That image and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, really? Which I think is, so right now it&#8217;s sort of a hidden feature, but I think that that&#8217;s coming down the road too. But it&#8217;s like, you know, Google, pretty much any, any of these services now can do image parsing, or excuse me, text parsing from images. So they&#8217;re also going to be reading these images, which is really, really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what alt text you might provide. Do you know what this&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:20] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> is called in Google? Is this&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:21] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> og? Uh, I would assume so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:34] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> Img, but it&#8217;s 92 by 92.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, I, I felt like there was, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s more of the Pinterest thought. You know, it&#8217;s like you go, oh, office.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when we think about the blog post stuff, This is pulling something here. It&#8217;s gotta be OG based, right? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to find. Say look at that six is, and then give it a little icon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:43] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Be honest. There&#8217;s no direct way to make your images show up, but somebody has to have figured this out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:48] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> Yeah. Because if we can get the specs we haven&#8217;t, we give the client a per a potential to let that show up. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because man, that&#8217;s compelling. I don&#8217;t know. Like this is Zoom ideas. So look at all these images in this display. There we go. See this. Well, I don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;re getting all that. This, this search comes up sometimes. See this? Mm-hmm. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re unlocking. Whatever this is, we&#8217;ll figure it out and say This is what you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what it&#8217;s called. And um, OMG mg does it? Yep. Do the possibility to do it, because I think this is where you start going into, I wish I had an idea for this, but I mean, the PINTERESTY type content. Mm-hmm. Recipes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:52] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Oh, there you go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these are really interesting, um, personality tests too, to see what you come up with on the spot. No, I&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:08] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> was like, they&#8217;re gonna know I&#8217;ve been liking an celery recipes,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:14] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> but see they as one does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s an I that that image is right there. How do we,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and it looks like&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:29] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> it&#8217;s 92 by 92 or that ratio, whatever, that Nope, that&#8217;s not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:34] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> That&#8217;s not it. It&#8217;s a slightly rectangle, but it&#8217;s not. And so what&#8217;s, what would be interesting is, um, view the view the actual source rather than inspecting. So just right click anywhere and say view, source</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and search for OG colon image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep typing image. It&#8217;ll pop up. Oh, sorry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:00] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> Hey, so this is interesting. Is this the action type&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:04] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> content so that, that you&#8217;d populate by like description you&#8217;d do in Yost and we certainly could do more. Um, like if you don&#8217;t want to have Yost installed since we&#8217;re already adding header, we could add more headers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again, not I, I don&#8217;t want to chase that if we can help it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same. Go to this. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You missed a two on the end, so it re cropped it. Oh, interesting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:52] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> So it&#8217;s live&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:52] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> cropping, that&#8217;s all it&#8217;s doing is Google. So the ogn, yeah. So it&#8217;s right. So, um, but it&#8217;s, but where is it? Why, why does it take the square? Because it doesn&#8217;t necessarily know, I mean, not all these websites are gonna have that auto cropping, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, so somewhere too, it&#8217;s saying there&#8217;s a square image. Let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s throw that into the search results. Look at this. They&#8217;re, they&#8217;re pulling the Twitter card too. Mm-hmm. It&#8217;s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:24] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> already baked in, I think. Yep. Interesting. I I just go, man. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>you know, some of this, like, these are appealing photos for sure, but I go, if you can put some piece of content right here, That&#8217;s helpful. Yep.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:52] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, I mean, and that&#8217;s the presumption, is that, so actually before you jump, um, go click on the one you just talked about or ultimate click on Ultimate, you know, any of these with that, that has a title, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go to that website. Oh, it&#8217;s you. That might be YouTube. That&#8217;s not gonna help us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they&#8217;ve got these big pictures, but I, what I&#8217;m trying to determine is if they have, like they&#8217;ve explicitly set an OG image that has this extra value in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so they&#8217;ve got two two, oops. Oh, that&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;m sure the first one just gets sucked in</p>\n\n\n\n<p>the article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I, so we&#8217;ll do a little research. We&#8217;ll find one of these, find a good example of this, and then see if we can&#8217;t decipher, you know, and or, um, do some more Googling to find out a, you know, when and what is what, when, and why does Google pull in an image in their actual search results? And, and not others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, is it, is it just an OG image and they&#8217;re cropping? It, is it, is there some other tag we don&#8217;t know about,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>but I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m anxious to get. This like when the first couple of templates done and out the door and in front of people, because I think it&#8217;s, you know, kind of like how your brain has said, oh, but what about this? And then, oh, I found this other thing over here. Like, it&#8217;s also, you know, but we started with, here&#8217;s what post status is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Branding already looks like we want recreate that as a starting point. Um, other people are gonna come to us. Vva from FIUs and Sayed from WP Beginner and whoever are gonna be like, okay, but you know, we need a way to accommodate our, our branding or the way the treatments we&#8217;ve already decided on in Canva if we&#8217;re gonna, you know, because we want our images to be pretty consistent, you know, across all socials forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, how do we create recreate hours? And it&#8217;s like, oh, okay, so we need the option to do background treatments or turn the whole thing 90 degrees, whatever. It&#8217;s, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. But that means that one Corey needs to finish the thing once and for all, and then two. Yeah, we wanna start getting the, the marketing asset aspects, assets out there, um, shopping cart finalized and stuff like that. Cuz it&#8217;s like, even if we get some beta testers, um, and we give them licenses or let them sign up for free or discount or something, you know, first year free, whatever it is, like we wanna get that sorted out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:30] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> Started with that yesterday and we didn&#8217;t need it. Didn&#8217;t get it finished. So I&#8217;ve got my screen up here where I started it, the logo, and then the website is part two. Uh, going back&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:43] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> to pause, squeeze, I started, um, flushing out just putting rectangles on a page for the homepage of O M G I M g.co. So it&#8217;s quite literally just boxes of color, but ready to have, [00:49:00] um, content float into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. All right. I&#8217;m gonna try to&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:08] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> carve off some time. Gotta get the logo going in process and then, uh, the website stuff. So&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:16] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I think, yeah, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m, I think standard, standard formula, you know, compelling tagline, value prop, a buy now button, you know, three icons with. With compelling value, props good enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, that&#8217;s all we need to start, so,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>okay. Yeah. If&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:45] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> I have an hour, um, I can get that cranked, cranked enough to start flushing out our page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:57] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Simpler is better. So, you know, feel free to delete or [00:50:00] hide rows. Like yeah, but just enough that we, it looks like something, um, like&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:50:08] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> here a box headline, what it does for you, how benefits you, three things show up in social.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And then features are like the nuts and bolts things and Yeah. Pricing. Yep. Yep.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:50:31] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> And yeah, and I&#8217;ve been waiting to do, like, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, at this point I&#8217;ve used e d D enough that I&#8217;ve got standard styles that I copy from site to site and ways to set up, like being able to sign in and manage your subscription kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, obviously they make it very easy, but I have a way that I like to lay things out. Um, but I&#8217;ve been waiting to do that. We, we need a logo, which helps us define a style and colors. To then carry that throughout the rest of the site. So our branding is somewhat consistent. So I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve been holding off on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, but all that takes an afternoon once we&#8217;ve got, yeah. The general look and feel</p>\n\n\n\n<p>back in our&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:51:16] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> conversation to, uh, put into there, do we want to go, I know we talked about this in Slack. Do we want to go with a. The eighties funky thought.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:51:32] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I, I mean, because of the OMG part, like I definitely think we want something fun. Um, but I don&#8217;t have any religion around how the rest of it, since I&#8217;m not creating the logo, like I&#8217;d rather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anybody grabs, whatever, whatever comes to their mind, like, that&#8217;s why we pay them. It&#8217;s like when I get on Fiver, I hire five people to do logos because I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m honestly paying them, not so much to create a logo, but to apply their own thinking to, you know, here&#8217;s a, here&#8217;s the color palette that, that jumps out at me when you tell me what the, the product does kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So</p>\n\n\n\n<p>idea is,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:52:23] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of almost like a Mac app. You know, you&#8217;re, it&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s solid that helps you look, look good and do things faster. Yep. Um, with images, Paula Showcase, I&#8217;m looking at some of these icons in my tray&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:52:44] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I started walking through, um, uh, product hunt, uh, um, featured, uh, uh, what was it? Make logo.ai. And I started plugging things in to kind of, and they, they want to charge you for the actual logos, but it was kind of neat that they came up, they present you with a bunch of concepts and so it was like, um, A magic wand over an image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like image generation or, um, cuz I, in the description I put in sharing and I put in, um, open graph image, you know, image generation. And so it was like, you know, do you want. Uh, a canvas or the, you know, the, the thing that the artist uses to put the paint on, um, the palette. I was like, eh, you know, do you want a magic wand to poof, an image appears?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eh, that&#8217;s getting closer cuz I want it to be that easy. You know? Do you want an icon of, they had one that was like, um, you know, a picture like a. A fake painting that had people all around it, like, you&#8217;re sharing that? I was like, no, definitely not. That&#8217;s terrible. You know, so it&#8217;s like these concepts of, um, of what we want, want it to represent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me it&#8217;s image generation, because that&#8217;s part of, that&#8217;s the, if you&#8217;ve got a workflow in the middle, you know, you&#8217;ve gotta write words, but you&#8217;ve also gotta generate images. And to me, that&#8217;s the problem we&#8217;re solving. But that&#8217;s also, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s feature not benefit. Yeah. I,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:54:36] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> I&#8217;m looking to pro probably kind to get some thoughts here to put into the designer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. I think I&#8217;ve got enough here. I&#8217;ll riff on. Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.[00:55:00]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:55:00] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> man. I, I just need a logo that looks really good because I&#8217;m gonna have a t-shirt made for Word camp us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:55:06] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> Yeah. Oh, that, that&#8217;s even better. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it&#8217;s almost like, huh? Okay. How would we want that to lick on the shirt?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:55:19] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> That actually helps me frame it to me, to me again, because of. Because of the OMG in the name, and we talked about going all, all caps, it&#8217;s like not a rainbow, but gradient of bright colors, you know, big fun font. Like I don&#8217;t want it to be goofy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t want it to be clown like, um, and that&#8217;s why I guess I&#8217;m shying away too from. Um, actually your, your MAC icons concept is, is a good idea of like, over to me. A lot of them are overwrought, three-dimensional, big drop shadow kind of thing, and it&#8217;s like, eh, I want, I want something, you know, more fun than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you, if you were gonna have a magic wand, like you&#8217;d want a bend in it, you&#8217;d want it to be almost cartoon-like or something. But then it&#8217;s, but then it&#8217;s not professional enough, so I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know. Uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it has to, it has to look good on your baseball cap there and it&#8217;s gotta go look good on my chest here. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The swag is more important than anything, let&#8217;s be honest. It is&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:56:45] <strong>Cory Miler:</strong> a good frame for me though, is like, how would that pop and how would we want that to look?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:56:54] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Let&#8217;s be done today. Um, I should have an update for you soon this week. Um, addressing all the, um, the bugs and extra bells and whistles that we talked about. Um, And in particular, I want to, like we said, I want to cut everything over to we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve got the sitewide handled, we need the post per post handled, like you said today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then plug in a logo, plug in a little, uh, style once we&#8217;ve got a style defined and then the plug-ins, I think ready to share. So that&#8217;ll be cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Cool, man. Keep me posted. All right.

His initial learning in the 1990s was through joining friends at a local pub where they could explore how websites were structured and learn to use chat software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This led to Stefano creating websites for fun in 1998, and his first paid job was for the shop where he bought comics. He turned to content management systems (CMS) to speed up the creation process for sites, but found he needed more documentation to really understand their capabilities. Then he read a magazine article about WordPress, a CMS which was being used to make incredible blog sites, and was supported by an international community and documentation. Over time, Stefano started using that documentation to work on websites in Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress provides a life-changing turning point&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stefano describes himself as an introvert. He found that WordPress helped him to work from home, to develop his skills and the quality of what he could produce, as well as build his self-confidence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A catalyst for the turning point in his life and career was the discovery of an area for events on the WordPress dashboard. On this page, he found a forthcoming local meetup in Rome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2017, Stefano took the step to go along to this event, led by a curiosity of what he might discover and intrigued by how a software could be supported by a vast community. The topic at the event was on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/\">WP-CLI</a>, a command line interface for WordPress. He recalled that he felt outside his comfort zone as he did not regard himself as a developer and at that point, had only used the software for simple jobs. He wondered whether using the software as his only CMS was going to be a long term option and if these meetups were suitable for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the meetup, people were talking about a forthcoming event, called WordCamp Rome. Through his research, he saw that there was a lot of enthusiasm for this event. This intrigued him and he wondered if it would show him that he could have a career using the software after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfamiliar with WordCamps, Stefano found it difficult at first to know what he could go to and how to get involved, but he persevered and attended the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;The WordCamp was a great discovery: talks at all levels from basic to those for developers, advanced and very advanced. I was immediately struck by the enthusiasm of the volunteers. It was an environment where I felt very comfortable, so much so, that I asked myself how I could participate in some WordCamps.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Stefano Cassone</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>From this event, Stefano was encouraged by those he met to consider applying as a volunteer for a future WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also much talk at the event about ‘Slack’. It was new to Stefano, but with help from those attending, he signed up for the messaging tool Slack, used by the WordPress community. He was still unsure how he could contribute, and if he would be welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Joining thousands of volunteer translators of WordPress</h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-wc-italia-2022.jpg?resize=800%2C600&ssl=1\" alt=\"Italian General Translation Editors at WordPress Italia 2022\" class=\"wp-image-15028\" />Italian General Translation Editors at WordPress Italia 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Stefano took the plunge and was excited to find there was a team called Polyglots. In this team, people from across the world<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\"> translate the WordPress software into many different languages</a>. He started with translating a theme he was using in his work. Little by little he became more interested in plugins and attended meetings with other translators. He offered his skills to translate into Italian themes and plugins in general and as his experience grew, he took on the volunteer role of a General Translation Editor. He also took care of the translation into Italian of the WordPress Core. More recently he has joined the group of translators for the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/helphub/\">HelpHub</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/\">WordPress documentation</a> system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “Participating in the WordPress Slack has helped me enormously: I’ve met a lot of people who I now call friends. Moreover, by translating, I learned a lot about how themes and plugins work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It&#8217;s a great way to contribute to WordPress, especially for someone like me who is not a developer. Translating also allows me to fully understand how WordPress works.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I always say that translating themes, plugins, and the Core software is the best way to learn WordPress, better than any course or book.”</p>\n<cite>Stefano Cassone</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sharing skills to support Open Source WordPress</h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"667\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-WC-2019.jpg?resize=667%2C500&ssl=1\" alt=\"Stefano volunteering as a photographer at a WordCamp in 2019 with other contributors.\" class=\"wp-image-15026\" />Stefano volunteering as a photographer at a WordCamp in 2019 with other contributors.\n\n\n\n<p>Stefano’s growing commitment to the open source WordPress project was further boosted through his volunteering. He was a volunteer at WordCamp Rome 2018 and participated there in his first Contributor Day where he had the opportunity to translate the software with others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was also able to bring his own hobbies and skills to help the project grow and reach others. One example was his passion for photography, and he volunteered as a photographer for many other events in Italy organized by the WordPress community. He said: “This commitment to the community also allows me to have fun: being a photographer means having the opportunity to walk around the halls and capture moments of the life of a WordCamp.” The more WordCamps he attended, the more he wanted to be part of and keep contributing to the wider WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contribution to WordPress is inspiring</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"Stefano at the Support Table at a WordPress Contributor Day\" class=\"wp-image-15025\" />Stefano at the Support Table at a WordPress Contributor Day\n\n\n\n<p>When Stefano was asked to become an organizer for the WordPress meetup in Rome in October 2019, he knew he wanted to be part of reaching and supporting more people in his area. He faced challenges with finding venues, but a greater issue was to come: the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spurred on by the <a href=\"https://it.wordpress.org/\">Italian WordPress community</a> as a whole, he was determined that the meetup was still needed. The regular event was transformed into an online meeting. He was able to gain help from people he had met as a volunteer to share their expertise with meetup attendees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community in Italy also worked together to put on WordCamp Italia online. It brought together the organizers of previous meetups and WordCamps, and new contributors too. Stefano volunteered in both online editions of this camp, including being part of the social and communication team. He found it to not only be a fun experience but also one that helped him grow professionally and learn from so many others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He went onto help restart the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/romawordpress/\">Rome WordPress meetup</a> in-person meetings in May 2022, was an organizer for the third WordCamp Italy, and has been volunteering for camps in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What will WordPress bring you?</h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"533\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-a-wc.jpg?resize=533%2C800&ssl=1\" alt=\"Stefano inspired by his journey at WordCamps asks what will WordPress bring you?\" class=\"wp-image-15024\" />Stefano inspired by his journey at WordCamps asks what will WordPress bring you?\n\n\n\n<p>“Persona and professional growth and friendship” are some of the things they have brought Stefano. Contributing boosted his confidence and willingness to try new opportunities in his work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “The best thing I got out of joining the WordPress community was the chance to collaborate with some people on a working basis and, I have to say, that was incredible. Being with many of them you have an incredible opportunity to grow in knowledge, you just have to be ready to learn. With WordPress you never stop learning.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His top recommendation is: “Join your local meetup or think about organizing one, it will introduce you to an amazing world. Don’t be afraid to meet people at WordCamps and Contributor Days, because you will learn more there than in dozens of courses. Talk to people at those events and don’t worry. The WordPress community is inclusive so you’ll always feel welcome, and you will see enthusiasm like you’ve never seen at other IT events. Sign-up and get involved.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community.&nbsp;Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Stefano Cassone (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/deadpool76/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>deadpool76</a>)&nbsp;for sharing about his adventures in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>webcommsat</a>), the late Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>sthakor</a>) and Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>meher</a>) for interviews, writing the feature and collaborating on images, to Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>cbringmann</a>), Mark Smallman (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marks99/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>marks99</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>marybaum</a>), and Maja Loncar (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/majaloncar/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>majaloncar</a>) for help with reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>People of WordPress</em>&nbsp;series thanks Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>chanthaboune</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>topher1kenobe</a>) for their support.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\"><img width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" /><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, a journey inside creating a block-based theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you all your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We released these podcast episodes every Wednesday, but next week there&#8217;s going to be a break. I&#8217;m going to be heading to WordCamp Europe in Athens to record some more interviews. And if you&#8217;re there, I do hope that our paths cross. Normal service will resume soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Mike McAlister, and he&#8217;s here to talk about his experiences creating a block-based theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike is a veteran product developer and designer in the WordPress space. He founded and sold multiple WordPress products, like Array Themes and Atomic Blocks. Now he&#8217;s focused on the future of WordPress with his new product brand, Ollie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike kicks off the podcast by telling us about his WordPress journey, and how WordPress blocks have renewed his passion for the platform. We get into some history and talk about the era when WordPress themes were extremely popular. Marketplaces like in Envato made it possible to sell themes and creates a career in ways hitherto unimagined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike explains what the key differences are between a block-based theme and a classic theme. How it&#8217;s possible to create themes inside the editor and how you can do this without needing to know much code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the fact that, if you are a coding expert, you could always create complex themes, but this fresh approach opens up the possibilities for those with less technical backgrounds. The experience in the editor might not be exactly what everyone wants, but it&#8217;s evolving quickly and maturing with every new release of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation moves onto why Mike is so confident that block-based themes are going to succeed. You don&#8217;t need to use one, and your trustee classic theme and the associated customizer, will work for the foreseeable future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then turn our attention to the technical hurdles that Mike has had to overcome. What new workflows and tools did he need to adopt and master to make his work possible? Mike&#8217;s been really focused on using WordPress core blocks to create his themes, digging into the weeds of what they can do and what their limitations are. It&#8217;s been a part of steady learning punctuated with minor setbacks when the editor and blocks are updated in unexpected ways. Thankfully, these bumps in the road are now relics of the past, as breaking changes have given way to stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then talk about a specific theme that Mike has just released. It&#8217;s called Ollie, and it&#8217;s the focus of the rest of the podcast. How did Mike build Ollie, and what is he hoping to achieve with this new brand?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns feature heavily in Ollie we talk about how it&#8217;s possible to alter the look and feel of your site quickly. Typography and colors are easy to change with the new suite of design tools which ship with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re wanting to develop block-based themes, or are just curious about how other developers are building them, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Mike McAlister.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Mike McAlister. Hello, Mike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:51] Mike McAlister: Hello. Thanks for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:52] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, you&#8217;re very welcome. Mike is going to be talking to us today about block based themes, block patterns, blocks in general, I&#8217;m sure. And if you haven&#8217;t been in the WordPress space for any great length of time, you are about to learn about Mike&#8217;s pretty impressive history in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Mike, it&#8217;s a fairly generic question, but I hope you don&#8217;t mind us asking you at first, just to orientate the listeners. Would you mind just telling us a little bit about yourself and your history, coding, theming, and whatever kind of other work you&#8217;ve done in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:24] Mike McAlister: Absolutely. Yeah, I&#8217;ve been around WordPress for some time now, probably since about 2010. 2009, 2010. So fairly early on. And I think I came upon WordPress like many folks, building client sites and looking for just a better way to do it. You know, when you&#8217;re in that world and you stumble upon WordPress, you&#8217;re like, whoa, light bulb moment. This is going to be a game changer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, I started pretty early on using WordPress to build websites for clients. And then at some point, I started to see the commercial aspect of it, right? Instead of building one theme for one client, I could build one theme and maybe sell it to a thousand different clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I experimented pretty early on with, you know, I have a history in design and so that was my focus. I thought that could be a differentiator for me. I&#8217;ll make themes that are just beautifully crafted, really lightweight. Maybe they don&#8217;t do everything under the hood, but they do specific things very well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so Array was the first theme shop that I had. And I operated all over the place. I had themes on my own site. I had them on the Themeforest marketplaces. I was selling themes on wordpress.com. So I was kind of everywhere and growing. And then at one point blocks became a thing, and so I dipped into there and started experimenting with blocks, via the Atomic Blocks theme which grew really quickly, it was one of the first block themes out there. And I think it was, blocks were still a really new thing and people were trying to understand what they were and what the benefits could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so having a plugin out there with all these examples in it, and kind of showing that, oh no, you can replace all kinds of stuff. Like short codes and all of these other archaic ways of building could be done with blocks now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I worked on that for a bit. And then in 2018 WP Engine acquired both the theme shop and the Atomic Blocks plugin. And worked there for four and a half years, and then just recently I have gone back into the freelance and entrepreneurial space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:21] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you very much indeed. That&#8217;s really, really interesting and it sounds to me at least anyway, as if you arrived on the WordPress scene, not only with the right products, but also at the right time. You kind of managed to hit that tidal wave just as it was creating out in the ocean somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you had the product. Everybody was buying themes at that time. Became really, really popular. Do you consider yourself to have had a lucky break there, in the sense that, do you feel that that is something which can be repeated in the year 2023? Or do you think that block themes and just themes in general, the shine and the commercial prospects of that has dwindled a little bit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:04] Mike McAlister: That early era was certainly something special. I think there was just so much attention focused on themes, and as this new shiny thing. And they unlocked a lot of capabilities for people. They were able to go from, trying to make their own sites. To making their own designs. To having these tried and tested templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that was a huge thing. And the rise of the Envato market at the time was a huge part of that success. Love it or hate it, at the time, that was a huge thing and proliferated WordPress themes out into the world, beyond our bubble. And so that I think was a huge deal at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, whether or not now we can kind of replicate that is really tough to say, because since then the market has become quite saturated, in that there are so many different ways of building with WordPress. And you have things that are spinning off like Elementor going off into their own world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re still kind of one foot in WordPress, one foot out. And we have all of these other. website builders that we didn&#8217;t have back then, other platforms. So there&#8217;s just so many different ways to build a website. WordPress is still massively popular, even if it&#8217;s slowly declining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We still have such a huge footprint on the web that it, there&#8217;s a ton of potential So, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see the same wave we saw before. I do think though that this whole new world of the block paradigm and block themes. It is the biggest opportunity commercially in WordPress I think that we&#8217;ve seen in a very long time. It may be the biggest we see for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:38] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. I think we should probably stray into that right, the outset, if that&#8217;s okay. Because, there&#8217;s probably a proportion of people who are listening to this podcast who are very, very technical. They completely get what you mean by block based themes and the opportunity afforded there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But equally, there may be a bunch of people who are listening to this who genuinely have no idea that there is such a thing as a block based theme. They&#8217;ve got a, what we would now call a classic theme, and it&#8217;s installed and it has been for a long time. And as far as they&#8217;re aware, there&#8217;s no change in their WordPress website. Things just carry on as normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But are you able to describe to us, I know this is a difficult question, and certainly trying to cram it into a portion of a WordPress podcast is a big ask. But are you able to give us a high level view on what a block theme is, and how it differs from a classic theme? Something which you might know, if you&#8217;ve got access to the customizer, you have a classic theme. If you don&#8217;t, you don&#8217;t. And so let&#8217;s take it from there. What are they and what do they promise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:34] Mike McAlister: Absolutely. So, let&#8217;s first just do quick block refresher in general. So blocks, instead of throwing your content all into TinyMCE or the content area, and kind of making it mostly text-based, and throwing some other little elements in with things like short codes, like we used to do in the past. Blocks, they&#8217;re basically content elements. It could be anything from a button, to a paragraph, to an image gallery, to a slider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And all of these things you add to the WordPress editor. And they could be used to build, you know, more beautiful content. They could be used to build page sections. They can be used to build a full page. And you put together enough blocks, and you can build an entire theme with it, right? So, WordPress comes with many blocks built in. And all of these things you use to build your website now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that in mind, block themes are effectively entire WordPress themes that are built entirely with blocks. And the benefit of that is that it makes your website almost entirely editable by you, in the editor. So instead of having to, you know, if you want to change your header, instead of going into the code and opening up the code editor and tinkering there and saving and going back to your site. You can go into the site editor and WordPress, which is effectively a interface inside the WordPress admin, where you can create your header.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can modify it. You can change the colors. You can add new links. You can change out your site logo. And all of that happens in the editor. It can be a no-code or low-code experience for you. So the benefit here is the customization, right? We can now get closer to the experience that you might have seen at something like a Squarespace or Wix where the interface and the experience is tailored around creation, and it&#8217;s more focused around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:31] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I guess if you are an expert themer and you&#8217;ve been creating themes for years, what it brings to the table, the way that you construct them is different. But you&#8217;ve always been able to achieve whatever it is that you wanted to achieve because you could write the code. But I suppose what this is bringing is the capability for non-technical people to be able to modify just any part of the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the header is typically fairly constrained, you know, header, navigation, logo, that kind of thing is normally what we see. But perhaps a better example would be a footer. Because typically your footer would be controlled by the theme and you&#8217;d go into the customizer and modify whatever options were available to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas now you can just build out rows, columns, put in images, put in contact forms, whatever you like, other navigation menus, anything. If you can imagine it as something that you can build in the block editor, that can then become your footer. You don&#8217;t need to dabble in any code at all. There&#8217;s a lot going on there, but you don&#8217;t need to be involved in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so non-technical people can become involved in that process and, you know, enjoy creating different aspects, different parts of their theme. That being said, what are your thoughts on the state of the UI for editing themes at the moment? We&#8217;re in May 2023. Version 6.2 of WordPress is the current latest version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it&#8217;s fair to say that it&#8217;s not where it probably wants to be in the end, but how do you think about it? How do you think about the UI? You&#8217;ve probably been in there, you&#8217;ve ironed out all the kinks, and got over all the road bumps that were in the way. But for a typical user, a non-technical user, do you feel it&#8217;s delivered on the promise that it hoped to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:09] Mike McAlister: I don&#8217;t think so yet. I talked to all kinds of WordPress users from novices to veterans. And the number one thing that always comes up is the UI the UX, the experience. And, you know, I get it because we&#8217;ve known WordPress for 20 years now. We&#8217;re celebrating a 20 year anniversary right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it has been one way for a very long time. And even some of the big changes that came, like the customizer, they weren&#8217;t that big of a change, right? They were bolted on and they were additive and iterative. But the block editor and going into the site editor and full site editing, these kinds of things, it&#8217;s quite different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s adding a lot to WordPress. It&#8217;s a lot of new context. It&#8217;s a lot of new paradigms. It&#8217;s a lot of new workflows, and I think that is a very difficult thing for people to figure out. Especially with the past few years where things have been shifting so much and people don&#8217;t know quite when to hop in. And then when they do, it doesn&#8217;t work exactly like they had anticipated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or some of the features are released as working prototypes. We&#8217;re kind of met with these things. And so I get the frustration when you hop in there and somebody&#8217;s telling you, oh, it&#8217;s way better, and you can do all this stuff now, and you&#8217;re, you install a block theme from dot org and it&#8217;s like half busted, and the styles don&#8217;t work and you don&#8217;t know your way around. So I get it. It can be a very frustrating experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will say the past few releases I think have been a lot better. And they&#8217;re ironing out a lot of the kinks. The ground underneath the software isn&#8217;t moving as much from release to release. And if you follow along on some of the GitHub tickets or you stumble into some of those, there&#8217;s a great deal of discussion going on about the many shortcomings of the UX. And so it is something that&#8217;s always being worked on. And I think it&#8217;s important to just remember that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is never going to be easy to change, to drastically change, a piece of software that is being used for so many use cases, for so many people. We know it powers half the web and to make a leap into the block era like this, it was never going to be easy. It was never going to be comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope that it will be worth it in that, these kind of growing pains in this transition will give us a new era. It will refresh WordPress. It will make it viable for another 10, 20 years. It will give us the new tools to keep up with these other platforms that are maybe outperforming us. And so while the growing pains are there and the experience is a little rough, I do think that it is all for the greater good of the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:45] Nathan Wrigley: Let&#8217;s explore the sort of reverse of that, if you like. And I&#8217;m going to use a product that I have as an example. I use Gmail to do my emails. And I have this Chrome extension, and the Chrome extension alters the Gmail interface in a way, which allows me to be slightly more productive. I won&#8217;t get into the detail, but it does that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And every couple of weeks something breaks, because Gmail alter some aspect of their interface. And the guy that makes the Chrome extension, he&#8217;s not in the loop of that. And the thing breaks and he has to contact all of his users and say, right on it. And gets it fixed and so on and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I feel, as we&#8217;re going to discuss in the future, you are now really committed to having a proportion of your income come from block based themes, and yet at the same time, although you&#8217;ve got, you&#8217;ve got a voice there and you&#8217;ve definitely got skin in the game. You are reliant upon the technology stack that is WordPress and it&#8217;s in a constant state of flux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said it&#8217;s not quite there yet. I just wondered, and I don&#8217;t wish for you to become incendiary or anything like that. I wondered if you could highlight some of the grievances that you, well, not grievances, some of the things that you wish were better right now. Some of the areas where, if you could be in control of just fixing it by clicking your fingers, what would you amend?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:03] Mike McAlister: Ooh, that&#8217;s a, that&#8217;s a really good question. Although I&#8217;m just releasing a block theme now, I&#8217;ve been dipping into and exploring block themes for years now. And only until recently did I feel like, okay, this is ready enough to put something out there. Because I&#8217;ve run a product business before, and a WordPress theme business before and support is a huge part of that, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in these early days of the block editor and block themes, with it being, you know, on a bit of shaky ground. Putting something out there I&#8217;ve seen it as like a support nightmare. I&#8217;m going to end up not just supporting my theme, I&#8217;m going to end up educating people on tons and tons of WordPress features, which I think that&#8217;s okay and great. And I think it&#8217;s actually a business model in itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t want to take on the frustration of the users, and have them funnel that through to something that&#8217;s your product, right? And they look at something I&#8217;m making and say, this thing sucks, or whatever. When really it&#8217;s just they don&#8217;t know this new WordPress yet, or they haven&#8217;t had the time, or that the pitfalls and the UX hurdles are being kind of painted onto your product. So yeah, I think up until recently I&#8217;ve felt like, okay, this is, it&#8217;s still going to be a bit of a transition, but I think it&#8217;ll be less painful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that being said if I could snap my fingers and have one thing, well I&#8217;ve just recently written a post about responsive controls, which is another big hurdle. But I think even more than that, I would snap my fingers and bring together this UI UX in a way that makes a lot more sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like we&#8217;re in two worlds here. I think we have many remnants of the old WordPress. In fact, if you&#8217;re not in the site editor, you maybe wouldn&#8217;t even know that there&#8217;s a new WordPress. You&#8217;re looking at the same sidebar, same posts, pages. All of that is the same and that&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s worked well for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now we have our other foot in this whole new era of the site editor and block editor and blocks and block themes. And then when you&#8217;re in the site editor you can edit things live and do all this stuff. And so I feel like there are two entirely different WordPresses existing in WP admin. And it is, to me, not a great experience. I feel like if we&#8217;re going to go this route, I feel like it should be almost entirely wrapped around the site editor experience, and we&#8217;re able to do almost everything in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that gives us an opportunity to maybe rethink, and this is, I know, grandiose and big ideas, and there&#8217;s probably a lot of people who are cringing at the thought of redoing a lot of WordPress. But I think that there is an argument to be made about kind of moving forward in a more bold and meaningful way. And tying that experience together. So that when you&#8217;re editing a page, it looks like you&#8217;re editing a page, and not like you&#8217;re editing a page with content field or something like that, you know? So the great unification of sorts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:57] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you. That&#8217;s really fascinating. In terms of the skillset that you&#8217;ve had to adopt over the last period of time. When you decided, okay, I&#8217;m going to go all in on blocks. And it sounds like you&#8217;ve been doing this really, right from the beginning, which is fairly impressive. Very prescient of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the new interesting, perhaps difficult, things that you&#8217;ve had to learn? The new tooling that you&#8217;ve had to acquire? What has had to become part of workflow over the last few years, which is different from how it would&#8217;ve been five, six years ago?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:26] Mike McAlister: Yeah, it&#8217;s It&#8217;s quite fascinating actually, because I think those of us who are in WordPress a long time, you would typically think that the answer would be like, oh, I had to learn Webpack or React or whatever. And if you&#8217;re building blocks, that might be the case. When I&#8217;m talking about block themes, it&#8217;s not a technical skillset that I&#8217;ve had to pick up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But literally just spending the time in WordPress and understanding how all these things work together. Learning fluently how to build with all of the core blocks, in a way that you can build a layout using columns and groups, and the alignment settings, and justification and the row block. It is a skill that has to be learned use all these things fluently, and to just know it like the back of your hand so that you can go and build out a pattern, a page, whatever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that did take, even for a WordPress veteran like me, quite a bit of time to get fluid with that stuff. But learning all of that stuff and then kind of dipping into block themes, that made that process a whole lot easier. Because block themes are just all of those things. It&#8217;s the row block. It&#8217;s the group block. It&#8217;s using the padding settings and building a design system with theme json.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that becomes a skillset in itself. And that&#8217;s where I spent so much time. And I think that&#8217;s why when I released this Ollie theme that we&#8217;ll talk about, I think a lot of people were kind of like blown away. Like, oh, you can do all this with this new stuff. And it&#8217;s all core and native features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it took me a long time to pull all that stuff together and to be able to present it and a package that was like, oh, okay, this is coherent and well made and well designed and it actually works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:07] Nathan Wrigley: How much does the sand shift beneath your feet? So you mentioned earlier about getting skilled with the interface and using the group block and managing it to make these pixel perfect, really beautiful layouts which we&#8217;ll get onto in a moment. How steady has that process been?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or have you noticed that your designs from, well, let&#8217;s not say month to month, maybe half a year to half a year. Are there things which come along in the core blocks, changes which are made in the core blocks, which upset what you&#8217;ve managed to lay out in this perfect way? Or has the progress been steady away? Everything looks the same today as it did a year ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:43] Mike McAlister: At this point, it&#8217;s very steady. The core blocks, the group blocks and things like this, buttons. These are not changing in any major way. There are little additions being made, but they&#8217;re iterative, and they&#8217;re backwards compatible as far as I&#8217;ve seen. There might be every once in a while, the spacing&#8217;s a little off or something like that and usually gets fixed pretty good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think with the amount of people using the Gutenberg plugin, where a lot of these big features are tried and tested and workshopped. I think there&#8217;s a good amount of eyeballs on these features there. That definitely helps, by the time it gets to core, it&#8217;s been vetted, it&#8217;s been worked out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People actually build with Gutenberg enabled. So I think there&#8217;s that. And so these days, when creating a theme, I didn&#8217;t have any major issues with the fundamentals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:31] Nathan Wrigley: Nice. I&#8217;m going to direct everybody listening to this podcast. Maybe just pause and go to this URL. The URL is olliewp.com. It is, as you might expect, o l l i e w p .com and have a little poke around. Have a look at what Mike has built, and what&#8217;s on offer. But just tell us about the theme itself. I&#8217;ve had a little bit of a play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I downloaded it. Currently, we can get onto this and the reasons for moment, it&#8217;s on, available on GitHub. You download it from there, and I installed it on a local install and had a play. Tell us a little bit, what&#8217;s the thinking here? Are you trying to make one theme that anybody can use? Do you have a particular niche in mind? What&#8217;s going on with Ollie?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:13] Mike McAlister: I think Ollie started as an experiment for myself. I used it as an opportunity to, like I was saying, to learn all of these features. And one of the best ways to learn them is to build a block theme. Because it forces you to use all these different things, like patterns and global styles, and theme json. All of these features that make up a good block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I started it as an experiment to learn, and then along the way, you know, as a product minded person, and somebody who&#8217;s had a theme shop before, I thought, no, there is some commercial value here. I don&#8217;t know what it is yet. But I thought on top of it being a potential pivot for me to do, I just saw it as an opportunity to dip back into WordPress in a more meaningful way, in the product space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I like creating things that people can learn from. I like putting things together in a package that you can hand off to somebody or send them the repo and they can see, and pick through the code and learn. And so that was the kind of intent behind Ollie. And right now it is, it&#8217;s just one theme with a bunch of beautiful patterns in it that you can use to quickly build out pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just using this early phase of Ollie to see what people think. How are people building with block themes? Are they building block themes? I think there&#8217;s so much unknown about this space because it&#8217;s so new, I&#8217;m just kind of sitting back and just learning and listening and watching people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do they want more patterns? Do they want pre-made sites with block themes? There&#8217;s so many questions that I have. I&#8217;m using it as an opportunity to effectively ask these questions and learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:41] Nathan Wrigley: The thing that really struck me, I should add at this point that I saw this from an article in the WP Tavern, which Sarah Gooding wrote on April 26th, 2023. I&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes. The thing that struck me immediately was the patterns. And I saw screenshots of the patterns and I thought, wow, they look great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there was a video that I think she put together, scrolling through some of the patterns and thought actually that&#8217;s new, that&#8217;s interesting. They are right on the money for me. They look how I wish I could do things. And so downloaded the theme and really discovered that you really have gone to town with the patterns. I don&#8217;t know what the number is. It certainly looks like it&#8217;s more than 50 or 60 or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That feels like where a lot of your endeavors have gone. So you&#8217;ve categorized them, obviously now in the site editor you can you click on the patterns button and then subcategories come down. And then a nice thumbnail appears, and you can enlarge those if you wish, on a big modal, which takes up the whole screen and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll see straight away that the effort in building a typical website, brochure site for somebody has been taken away. So that&#8217;s my question. Did you approach this with patterns in mind? Like this is going to be a repository of great patterns and the rest hopefully will build itself, if you know what I mean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:56] Mike McAlister: Yeah, absolutely. I knew right away patterns were and are going to be a huge deal. Way back, late 2019, I was even playing with this rudimentary idea of what patterns could be with my friend John Paris. We experimented and prototyped out this idea of sections and layouts in WordPress. And it was effectively what would become patterns. This idea that you have pre-designed sections of your site, that you can click together like Lego pieces and make full layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always looked at patterns as a huge opportunity because it takes the pain out of building websites or even just sections. If I&#8217;m able to put together a beautifully designed hero section, or a featured section with blocks and make it look great and hand it over to you. You can throw that on your page. You don&#8217;t have to mess with the design. You just tweak the colors if you want, and change the content. And then you go about your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve removed the pain of even you having to build your own blocks or your own patterns. And hopefully that is the paradigm that we go with. Hopefully people latch onto this idea that maybe I don&#8217;t have to tinker with every single part of my website. Maybe just going with these beautiful designs, changing the content, changing the color, and then focusing on my content, and focusing on my audience and focusing on my following. And I think the patterns are going to be a huge deal for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:21] Nathan Wrigley: Truly I think the designs are absolutely fabulous. They are categorized into posts, texts, call to action, cards, features, heroes, pages, prices and testimonials. Who knows, maybe that will be expanded over time. But in each of those there&#8217;s in some cases a handful and in many cases multiple dozens really of different patterns that you can select.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;ve never had the experience of doing this in a theme, you just pick on one that you like, and you just click on the icon and there it is. It&#8217;s now the next part of your website. And you can then amend it, you can change it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give us a bit of an insight into what people can do in terms of saving things. So let&#8217;s imagine that they&#8217;re using yours as sort of boiler plate and they&#8217;re going to click things in, but they want to amend the colors. Yours is fairly opinionated. It&#8217;s nice dark black, and there&#8217;s this lovely kind of blue color, which dominates everywhere. But obviously that might not fit with everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it fairly straightforward, again for inexperienced users, to save those and modify them and keep their own modifications with this new site editing interface?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:25] Mike McAlister: Absolutely. That&#8217;s kind of the beautiful part about this, right? Is that you can go into one of your preexisting pages and click to add one of the patterns I&#8217;ve designed, and put it on your page. Or you can throw a full layout, which I&#8217;ve included a few full layouts, like home, about, and features, and things like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You throw it onto your page. You customize it how you want. You can change the content inline. You can change the colors on the page if you want. Or you can go to the global styles in the site editor, and you can change that bluish purple color that I&#8217;ve chosen to whatever color you want, your brand color. And instead of going through and changing it in every little pattern, it will change that color on every single pattern I&#8217;ve included in this theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you don&#8217;t have to go change the colors anywhere. It will literally propagate that color throughout the whole site. Because this whole thing is a live design system, right? It&#8217;s effectively a design system that is tied into every aspect of WordPress. So when you&#8217;re in the site editor, when you&#8217;re in posts, when you&#8217;re in pages, all of these styles travel with these patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even typography, you don&#8217;t like the font? You can change the font. It&#8217;ll propagate through the whole thing because that&#8217;s how this is all wired up. So yeah, so if you want to go in and change a page, all you do is, you go in there, add a pattern, save it. Save it just like you would any other page. And it&#8217;s good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:47] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, it is increasingly becoming a really compelling system. It just requires people like you to get as many people over that hump as possible and experiencing it. But I can only say if you download it, have a go. Within minutes I suspect that you&#8217;ll have something that you are very, very happy with and that you can modify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the patterns of themselves, is that an area that you&#8217;ve explored? Or would like to explore commercially? So okay, I know you&#8217;ve got Ollie, but have you given any thought to the commercial possibilities of just patterns, simply patterns? Not bound to any theme. Just a downloadable set of patterns. And obviously you&#8217;re a very, very credible designer, we can see that. That you could then give to people, sell to people, so that they can download them into any site no matter what block-based theme they&#8217;re using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:34] Mike McAlister: I always knew patterns were going to be a big deal. But I think, after just releasing Ollie to GitHub and seeing it get picked up by a few news outlets and some people on YouTube, were making videos about it. I think the number one thing everyone always raves about is the patterns. And maybe if they&#8217;ve explored patterns before on wordpress.org or used other themes that have patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re just kind of underwhelming typically. But I think I did spend a great deal of time making sure these patterns were making a statement. They are saying, no you can do this in WordPress. I wanted to prove that I can design something as good, if not better, than what we had before. And I&#8217;ll do it all with blocks, native blocks. Not one custom blocks in there. These are all just core blocks, and they&#8217;re going to be beautiful, and they&#8217;ll be fully responsive and fully customizable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I think that&#8217;s what people see. And when they see these patterns and how they all cohesively fit together. You can pop these onto a page in any different order and they kind of just fit together and that&#8217;s part of the overall design system. But yeah, so I see patterns as a huge opportunity and I wasn&#8217;t sure commercially. And still I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m using this opportunity to ask a lot of questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think the first few weeks, the response has been largely very positive about patterns. And so I&#8217;m definitely curious about that. And I think there&#8217;s opportunities to do more advanced patterns, and maybe use some pro blocks to make patterns even more appealing. So yeah, pro patterns is definitely something I&#8217;m exploring</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:07] Nathan Wrigley: You mentioned that you&#8217;d spent a lot of time learning the core blocks, and you also just mentioned that everything that comes with Ollie is based around a core block. Was that a straightforward experience? Or did you find that there are certain limitations in what you could achieve based upon the capabilities of core blocks? Or would you say basically you can implement almost any design you wish with core block? Certainly looks like you&#8217;ve managed to achieve that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:34] Mike McAlister: Sometimes I&#8217;d have an idea of what I wanted to do, and couldn&#8217;t quite do it. But I think if you get clever, you can get really close, right? For example, I would love if WordPress had a icon block. A core icon block that we could tie into. I don&#8217;t want to have to make my own, because there&#8217;s a bunch out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also, you know, in terms of the ease of distribution and giving customers designs right out of the box. I don&#8217;t want them to have to install a plugin to do it. And icons are so prolific. I would just hope that we could have that in core. Well, we can&#8217;t have that yet. And so, when doing simple things like wanting to add an icon here for people to see like, kinda like a placeholder for an image or an icon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used the HTML star, right? And I use that in ratings, you know, in design, like if you want to put a rating there, I put like five HTML stars, and I use it on feature sections. So, clever little things like that. It&#8217;s giving people enough to understand, oh this is what this is meant to be. This is the design. Oh, I might put my own icon here. Or even things like cleverly using the rows and group blocks to get things aligned how you want. Grouping of blocks to do unique things with them, spacing wise. It&#8217;s just a lot of clever usage of what&#8217;s there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think part of that does come from tinkering enough. And if you really want to get that design out of your head and on to the page, you&#8217;ll figure it out. But it might take, it might take some tinkering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:01] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I&#8217;m on the install that I have at the moment and I&#8217;m on the star rating. You&#8217;ve got five stars, and I can see that they&#8217;re using paragraph blocks. And then elsewhere you&#8217;re using the social icons block to display those social icons. And I guess that&#8217;s the experience you would want, is just pick an icon, much like you do in the social icons block and make it more straightforward. That&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why GitHub? Why not the WordPress repo? Was there some sort of decision there? Again, I should emphasize it, at this moment in time, if you want to grab this theme, you&#8217;re going to be heading over to GitHub and downloading it. Why there and not in the repo? Is there a decision behind that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:36] Mike McAlister: No philosophical decision. I think it will be on the repo soon actually. Like I said, with these block themes, there&#8217;s so much to learn and I wanted to put it out there. You know, it worked great for me when I was building it and making it. But I wanted to get it out there and get people using it to understand if there was any major shortcomings or just catch any early usability patterns that I was seeing. Any issues like that and see like, oh, actually people don&#8217;t love these patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, is there something about the workflow that I could improve before releasing it to a wider audience? So, I just mostly wanted to iron out all the kinks and GitHub was just the obvious place to do that. But to be honest a lot of the quirks that people have brought up with the theme on GitHub and the GitHub issues and stuff, are largely just Core issues. Just usability, preferences and workflow preferences and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t uncovered any major issues and so I feel like what I&#8217;m going to do is kind of wrap it up. It&#8217;s already fully tested and gone through the theme check and everything. So it&#8217;s pretty much ready to go. And I think I&#8217;ll do that in the next week or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:41] Nathan Wrigley: Oh, okay. In that case, by the time this podcast airs, this question will be somewhat moot. But anyway, worth, asking I think. I noticed as I was moving around on the site, olliewp.com. I noticed buried somewhere was referenced to Ollie Cloud, and that got me thinking, okay, in that case, is Ollie something bigger than simply this one theme?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going to take the conversation next. Is Ollie, in the same way that you had Array Themes and you had Atomic Blocks. Is Ollie something bigger for you, Mike? Is that a direction that you&#8217;re going to take it in? Are you now hoping to, sort of, have a bunch of things wrapped around in the Ollie branding?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:22] Mike McAlister: I think so. I wasn&#8217;t sure about that initially. Again, this just kind of started as a experimental WordPress theme. But I don&#8217;t know the product creator in me, the entrepreneur in me, always tries to see things from that sphere as well. And so as I&#8217;m looking at the WordPress ecosystem, and I&#8217;m exploring what is this thing like now? It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve had a product out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do see all kinds of opportunities, and I&#8217;m still learning what they are. But I also have my own opinionated ideas about how we could wrap up this new, all these new capabilities, and deliver a new experience. A premium experience with some of this stuff. And so, on the Ollie WP website I had, I do have a box at the bottom about Ollie Cloud. And the idea there, I think is it could be Ollie Cloud, it could be Ollie Pro. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m really just gathering feedback and seeing what people want, as I mentioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the idea is that all of these new features, these theme assets, patterns and theme json files and all that stuff. They&#8217;re all very lightweight, and very movable, and very modular, and they can kind of plug and play in to WordPress. And I don&#8217;t know, I think there&#8217;s an interesting idea about the experience about how we build sites these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should you have to start from scratch on every site? And should we still be copying and pasting themes around like it&#8217;s the mid two thousands? And is there a better way of doing that? Is there a better way of pulling in a site template?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of interesting things there and I think, another thing I&#8217;m learning, and I think we&#8217;ve seen just generally is that, I don&#8217;t know, I think users are maybe a little fatigued with that in WordPress. Starting with a blank slate and being like, ugh, I have to find a theme and then I have to maybe try out a few themes, and then I don&#8217;t know if I need to pay for one, and then I need a form block, and then all of a sudden I need a buy a contact form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s a bunch of upsells for contact forms. And I don&#8217;t know. All that stuff to me, after all these years on WordPress, feels kind of icky. Uh, I guess. And I think customers and users want experiences and solutions more than they want individual themes and plugins. So a premium offering or a premium experience is something I&#8217;m interested in. What kind of experience can we do differently that delivers the same result, but takes all of the pain building on WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:46] Nathan Wrigley: It kind of feels as if you may be repeating history for yourself here in that, you know, 2010. Array themes, we mentioned you were right there at the beginning of that tidal wave. Maybe with a fair wind, the same thing may happen again here? You may well have discovered that seam of gold, just as it&#8217;s starting to take off. Because all the chatter that I&#8217;m listening to at the moment is very much related to blocks and exploring patterns, blocks, block based themes, and how you can maybe tie those three things together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And pro blocks, which bring additional functionality. You know, areas where Core perhaps doesn&#8217;t cut it. I&#8217;m thinking, in my case, one that just keeps coming into my head is a superior navigation block, that does a whole load of styling and what have you. And who knows what&#8217;s going to be around in two or three years time? But there do seem to be companies who are straying into this and dabbling with it and trying, like you are, I guess, to figure out what the landscape may look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:43] Mike McAlister: Yeah, I&#8217;m just as unsure I think as anybody about where this thing goes. But I&#8217;ve never been afraid to try and put in the work to get something going and see where it goes. Like I said at the top, I think there&#8217;s an opportunity here that we&#8217;ve not seen in a long time in WordPress and may never see again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if these are the early days of the new generation of WordPress, I&#8217;m certainly going to try and throw my hat into the ring and craft a new experience, and maybe rebrand WordPress, and help outside folks see WordPress in a new light. Because I think that&#8217;s a huge part of this new reboot. Is that WordPress maybe hasn&#8217;t been traditionally like, quote unquote cool, to a lot of web folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s certainly very popular and very prolific, but we maybe haven&#8217;t attracted the best talent and the best coverage in the wider web world. So, I look at it as an opportunity to rebrand that and maybe grab another cohort of the web that we haven&#8217;t had yet. And I think part of that is new products, and different products, and better looking products, and better experiences, and taking some of the pain out of WordPress that we&#8217;ve traditionally had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:57] Nathan Wrigley: If somebody listening to this is inspired about block themes in general, because that&#8217;s been the broad tenor of what we&#8217;ve talked about. Do you have any names to drop or resources that you&#8217;ve used, that enabled you to learn this kind of stuff? And if you do mention anything, I will endeavor to link it into the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t mean like a laundry list of hundreds of things, but a couple of things which you thought, actually, for those that are exploring this, this is a really great resource. This is a really profoundly interesting person and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:24] Mike McAlister: Yeah. First I would start, I&#8217;m somebody who I need to work from examples. I need to see the code and I need to see the, a working thing to get inspired and know how to do things. So, on that note you mentioned that Ollie is on GitHub. It will remain there. This version of Ollie that I&#8217;m putting out is always going to be free. And always going to be on GitHub. So it is a great resource for picking through the code, especially theme json, where I think there&#8217;s so, so much you can do in there, but it is hard to understand what you can do when you&#8217;re kind of looking at it from the outside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re curious, start there, because I&#8217;ve wired this thing together. I think how it should be, or largely how it should be at this moment in time. And so it&#8217;ll give you a great headstart and great understanding of how all these things tie together. So start there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in terms of people, I actually, on my Twitter list or on my Twitter page, I have a list of WordPressers. And on that list is a great many folks who are a lot of voices in this stuff. WordPress Core folks like Nick Diego and Rich Tabor, and Carolina Nymark. These people spent a great deal of their time in WordPress, and listening to WordPress conversations, and taking part in the GitHub conversations. So I would check out that list. I can actually send it over to Nathan as well if he wants to include it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:43] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&#8217;d be great. I will in some way copy and paste it into the show notes or somehow link to it. But yeah, that&#8217;s really helpful. Thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:50] Mike McAlister: Twitter is, love it or hate it. It is where traditionally the WordPress community has hung out, and so it still is the case, even though some people are coming and going. It still is where a lot of conversation happens on WordPress and WordPress development and what&#8217;s new. And so it is a good place even if you just want to read and follow along. It is a good place to see those conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:13] Nathan Wrigley: I will link to whatever it is that you send me, Mike. Thank you for that. Okay, just one final question. It&#8217;s more about people finding you really. If somebody&#8217;s listened to this and their interest has been peaked. What are the the best ways, it sounds like it might be Twitter, but it may not be. What are the best ways to get in touch with you, Mike?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:32] Mike McAlister: Yeah, I&#8217;m most active on Twitter. Like I said, I think that&#8217;s kind of where our community is still thriving. And so, yeah, I&#8217;m on Twitter largely. My personal account is @mikemcalister. I do a great deal of tweeting about WordPress and design and the intersection of all these different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, there&#8217;s a dedicated Twitter account for Ollie as well. You can follow that, that&#8217;s @buildwithollie. I&#8217;m also writing on the Ollie WP blog fairly regularly. So this is another place where I&#8217;m able to share my learnings of all of this stuff with block themes and WordPress in general. And, I&#8217;m writing some long form content, some short tips and tricks and, that&#8217;s all the time I have to hang out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:17] Nathan Wrigley: You have other important things to by the sounds of it. Mike, really appreciate you chatting to us today. Thank you so much, and every success with Ollie, whatever direction you take with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:28] Mike McAlister: Thank you so much. I love chatting about this stuff and this was a great form for that, so thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://mikemcalister.com/\">Mike McAlister</a>, and he’s here today to talk about his experiences creating a block-based theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike is a veteran product developer and designer in the WordPress space. He&#8217;s founded and sold multiple WordPress products like Array Themes and Atomic Blocks. Now he’s focused on the future of WordPress with his new product brand, Ollie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike kicks off the podcast by telling us about his WordPress journey, and how WordPress blocks have renewed his passion for the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into some history, and talk about the era when WordPress themes were extremely popular. Marketplaces like Envato made it possible to sell themes and create a career in ways hitherto unimagined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike explains what the key differences are between a block-based theme and a classic theme. How it’s possible to create themes inside the editor, and how you can do this without needing to know much code. We talk about the fact that, if you’re a coding expert, you could always create complex themes, but this fresh approach opens up the possibilities for those with less technical backgrounds. The experience in the editor might not be exactly what everyone wants, but it’s evolving quickly and maturing with every new release of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation moves onto why Mike is so confident that block-based themes are going to succeed. You don’t need to use one, and your trusty classic theme and the associated Customizer will work for the foreseeable future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then turn our attention to the technical hurdles that Mike has had to overcome. What new workflows and tools did he need to adopt and master to make his work possible? Mike’s been really focussed on using WordPress Core Blocks to create his themes, digging into the weeds of what they can do and what their limitations are. It’s been a path of steady learning, punctuated with minor setbacks when the editor and blocks are updated in unexpected ways. Thankfully, these bumps in the road are now relics of the past, as breaking changes have given way to stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then talk about a specific theme that Mike has just released. It’s called Ollie, and it’s the focus of the rest of the podcast. How did Mike build Ollie, and what is he hoping to achieve with this new brand?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns feature heavily in Ollie and we talk about how it’s possible to alter the look and feel of your site quickly. Typography and colours are easy to change with the new suite of design tools which ship with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re wanting to develop block-based themes, or are just curious about how other developers are building them, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://themeforest.net/user/arraythemes\">Array Themes</a> on Themeforest</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://atomicblocks.com/\">Atomic Blocks</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://olliewp.com/\">OllieWP website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/OllieWP/ollie\">Ollie GitHub repo</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/lists/1648871212645318658\">WordPressers Twitter list</a> mentioned by Mike</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemcalister\">Mike&#8217;s Twitter</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 May 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"Do The Woo Community: Let’s Meet or Do a Quick Recording at WCEU 2023 in Athens\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=75259\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://dothewoo.io/lets-meet-or-do-a-quick-recording-at-wceu-2023-in-athens/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:412:\"<p>If you are going to be there, and I know I\'m going to be there, hope we get to see each other. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;

WordPress is the community of people who have built it and contributed to it over the last <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/05/celebrating-20-years-of-wordpress/\">two decades</a>, and before that, when it was a little known blogging package called b2. So, thank you so much to everyone who has contributed to WordPress over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has given me, and countless others, many opportunities we couldn&#8217;t have dreamed of. Just over two years <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2003/05/wordpress-now-available/\">after WordPress was first released,</a> I joined Automattic. Working on two machines, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/\">Matt</a> and I started work on the first WordPress.com. Here I am, almost 18 years later, and still working on WordPress related software. What a journey. Matt <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2023/05/wp20-audrey-scholars/\">marked the occasion</a> by announcing a generous <a href=\"https://audrey.co/scholars/\">scholarship programme</a>.

He ruminates that Gutenberg in WordPress and Gutenberg as a plugin confused site owners. Some users don&#8217;t know that the block editor has been part of WordPress since 2018, and and think, they need to install the Gutenberg plugin to get it. Marsland does not want to deprive users to get early access to new features, nor developers to test new features with a smaller feedback loop. If I understand Marsland&#8217;s plea, he feels a Core Beta program might be more suitable than a separate plugin that confuses users and fragments the development. Marsland makes a strong case. Having a faster release cycle for WordPress core, is something the core team has been kicking around, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to materialize. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deployment of a major WordPress release is coupled with quite a few manual processes. There are many hands needed for a 2-month release cycle. Just look at the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-2/\">release squad for 6.2</a>. There are around 20 people involved just for the release alone. The total number of contributors was  over 600. Getting that group together for more releases has been a struggle in the years that planned for four releases instead of the three recently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to that, a Gutenberg plugin release every two weeks, is mostly automated and takes about one to three people to put a release together, with 60 to 70 contributors merging PRs for the release milestones. As long as those release processes between WordPress core and Gutenberg plugin are not synced up, keeping new feature development in the Gutenberg plugin seems to be a very WordPress-y solution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> published the next call for testing: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/05/18/fse-program-testing-call-23-rapid-revamp/\"><strong>FSE Program Testing Call #23: Rapid Revamp</strong></a>.

Both paths are available and with the backwards compatibility promise that WordPress core gives, it will stay that way in the future. All the new features do is make WordPress more flexible and if users and site owners use block themes, they can modify and customize their site in ways, that is not possible with classic themes. Karkovack concluded: &#8220;This is what separates WordPress from other platforms. You aren’t stuck with a single way to do things. Sometimes this can create extra layers of complexity. But it’s arguably better than being limited in how or what you can build.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-theme-development-for-full-site-editing-and-blocks\">Theme Development for Full Site Editing and Blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Did you know that you can customize core block style variations directly from theme.json?&#8221; Asked <strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justintadlock/status/1662127521960165377\">on Twitter.</a> In his latest post on the WordPress Developer Blog,  <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2023/05/customizing-core-block-style-variations-via-theme-json/\"><strong>Customizing core block style variations via theme.json</strong></a>, Tadlock shows you how, and also points to additional enhancements that are being worked on. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8220;Keeping up with Gutenberg &#8211; Index 2022&#8221;</a>&nbsp;</strong><br />A chronological list of the WordPress Make Blog posts from various teams involved in Gutenberg development: Design, Theme Review Team, Core Editor, Core JS, Core CSS, Test and Meta team from Jan. 2021 on.

They discussed how AI is changing the developer experience. Mullenweg is optimistic about AI working with open source and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributors-discuss-how-core-can-better-enable-ai-innovation\">reiterated what he said recently on Post Status&#8217; Slack</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Open source and AI are the two mega trends of the next twenty years, and the reason they are complimentary is that GPT4 hasn&#8217;t read Shopify&#8217;s code. It&#8217;s read Drupal&#8217;s code and WordPress&#8217; code, and all 55,000 plugins and everything else, so it can write it. If you ask it to write a website, it&#8217;s going to write it in an open source thing. It&#8217;s not going to write it in these propriety things.  From an evolutionary point of view, if you go far enough into the future, someday we&#8217;ll see even our proprietary competitors &#8211; the Wix&#8217;s and Squarespace and Shopify&#8217;s of the world, actually running on open source software. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s part of our vision with Gutenberg as well as why we made it an even more permissive license than the GPL. We dual-licensed it under the MPL so it could even be embedded in commercial applications, because I really think it&#8217;s so important that I want it to be in even commercial applications.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYhIItlPPOs\">Check out the video</a> embedded below to hear this historic conversation between some of the pioneers of open source publishing on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 May 2023 19:30:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Matt: With Mike Little and Dries Buytaert\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=85035\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://ma.tt/2023/05/with-mike-little-and-dries-buytaert/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:351:\"<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week I had the honor of being on stage at the Royal Society of Arts in London with Mike Little, the co-founder of WordPress, and Dries Buytaert, the founder of Drupal, which is one of the open source projects I have the most respect and admiration for.

As part of this process, contributors created a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R0dxV0RCeALfD5ZO25w4yuBM4fCzL2VXdqY67ygbl8U/edit?pli=1&resourcekey=0-NXgdwyfTKuuuMVbj-D7tkg#heading=h.vk12eaqoj096\">methodology</a> with a standard set of tools that can be used to collect and share profiling data for various components of the application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team tested a classic theme (Twenty Twenty-One) and a block theme (Twenty Twenty-Three) configured with the <a href=\"https://github.com/WPTT/theme-test-data/\">Theme Unit Test data</a>. They tested out of the box functionality, in addition to different scenarios such as a homepage displaying the latest posts, a basic text-only page, a page with a large set of images and default blocks, and a homepage and a basic page with translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tests uncovered numerous performance issues which the team has documented with related trac tickets and detailed in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/25/wordpress-6-2-server-performance-analysis-summary/\">summary</a> of the findings. The first priority identified for improvement is template loading for classic themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although WordPress contributors are blazing forward on the project&#8217;s roadmap for the block editor, with most of the headline release features focused on site editing, block theme adoption is not where one might expect it to be more than four years after Gutenberg landed in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A majority of websites still use the classic theme architecture, so improvements made here could have the largest horizontal impact,&#8221; 10-up sponsored WordPress Core Committer Joe McGill said in the summary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McGill referenced <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wpp-research/pull/53\">data collected in April 2023 for the HTTPArchive</a> which uses a query based on a new HTTP Archive custom metric to detect block theme adoption. Based on this information, improving template loading and rendering for classic themes should remain a high priority. Most of the WordPress-powered web is still running on classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The summary highlights the improvements for template loading that would make the most impact: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>In the classic theme tested, the most expensive process is related to locating and rendering template parts. This starts with get_template_part(), includes the process of locating the template part files with locate_template(), and rendering the content for each template part. This whole process accounted for approximately 30–60% of the entire server response in the test results, with much of that time spent handling filesystem checks (e.g., file_exists() is responsible for 4–9% of all time measured and can likely be optimized with a cache), rendering widget blocks, etc. Given many of these filesystem checks aren’t likely to produce different outcomes often between requests, there are likely opportunities to find substantial improvements here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>These improvements are the first of five priorities the Performance Team identified as the result of analysis. The second recommendation is to improve translation loading, as more than <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">56% of all WordPress websites</a> are using translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other three priorities include improvements for block-powered sites, with the first two ringing up as the most costly operations in terms of performance:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Improve handling of block registration from metadata</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improve resolving block templates</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improve rendering of block widgets</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These efforts will likely require additional research and architectural design before engineering begins,&#8221; McGill said. &#8220;All other items identified could be worked on directly through individual Trac tickets as capacity allows.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Performance Team is considering making the tooling for performance profiling more broadly available so other contributors can extend their work. In the future, they may also consider contacting hosting companies to get them to run analysis on their infrastructure and examine additional use cases, such as PHP versions, Object Caching configuration, and more. Once the methodology used for this analysis is nailed down, future efforts to improve performance may become more frequent and  easier to produce.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 May 2023 03:57:16

Lorem Ipsum е индустриален стандарт от около 1500 година, когато неизвестен печатар взема няколко печатарски букви и ги разбърква, за да напечата с тях книга с примерни шрифтове. Този начин не само е оцелял повече от 5 века, но е навлязъл и в публикуването на електронни издания като е запазен почти без промяна. Популяризиран е през 60те години на 20ти век със издаването на Letraset листи, съдържащи Lorem Ipsum пасажи, популярен е и в наши дни във софтуер за печатни издания като Aldus PageMaker, който включва различни версии на Lorem Ipsum.\n\nCatalà\n\nLorem Ipsum és un text de farciment usat per la indústria de la tipografia i la impremta. Lorem Ipsum ha estat el text estàndard de la indústria des de l\'any 1500, quan un impressor desconegut va fer servir una galerada de text i la va mesclar per crear un llibre de mostres tipogràfiques. No només ha sobreviscut cinc segles, sinó que ha fet el salt cap a la creació de tipus de lletra electrònics, romanent essencialment sense canvis. Es va popularitzar l\'any 1960 amb el llançament de fulls Letraset que contenien passatges de Lorem Ipsum, i més recentment amb programari d\'autoedició com Aldus Pagemaker que inclou versions de Lorem Ipsum.\n\nHrvatski\n\nLorem Ipsum je jednostavno probni tekst koji se koristi u tiskarskoj i slovoslagarskoj industriji. Lorem Ipsum postoji kao industrijski standard još od 16-og stoljeća, kada je nepoznati tiskar uzeo tiskarsku galiju slova i posložio ih da bi napravio knjigu s uzorkom tiska. Taj je tekst ne samo preživio pet stoljeća, već se i vinuo u svijet elektronskog slovoslagarstva, ostajući u suštini nepromijenjen. Postao je popularan tijekom 1960-ih s pojavom Letraset listova s odlomcima Lorem Ipsum-a, a u skorije vrijeme sa software-om za stolno izdavaštvo kao što je Aldus PageMaker koji također sadrži varijante Lorem Ipsum-a.\n\nČesky\n\nLorem Ipsum je demonstrativní výplňový text používaný v tiskařském a knihařském průmyslu. Lorem Ipsum je považováno za standard v této oblasti už od začátku 16. století, kdy dnes neznámý tiskař vzal kusy textu a na jejich základě vytvořil speciální vzorovou knihu. Jeho odkaz nevydržel pouze pět století, on přežil i nástup elektronické sazby v podstatě beze změny. Nejvíce popularizováno bylo Lorem Ipsum v šedesátých letech 20. století, kdy byly vydávány speciální vzorníky s jeho pasážemi a později pak díky počítačovým DTP programům jako Aldus PageMaker.\n\nRomâna\n\nLorem Ipsum este pur şi simplu o machetă pentru text a industriei tipografice. Lorem Ipsum a fost macheta standard a industriei încă din secolul al XVI-lea, când un tipograf anonim a luat o planşetă de litere şi le-a amestecat pentru a crea o carte demonstrativă pentru literele respective. Nu doar că a supravieţuit timp de cinci secole, dar şi a facut saltul în tipografia electronică practic neschimbată. A fost popularizată în anii \'60 odată cu ieşirea colilor Letraset care conţineau pasaje Lorem Ipsum, iar mai recent, prin programele de publicare pentru calculator, ca Aldus PageMaker care includeau versiuni de Lorem Ipsum.\n\nСрпски\n\nLorem Ipsum је једноставно модел текста који се користи у штампарској и словослагачкој индустрији. Lorem ipsum је био стандард за модел текста још од 1500. године, када је непознати штампар узео кутију са словима и сложио их како би направио узорак књиге. Не само што је овај модел опстао пет векова, него је чак почео да се користи и у електронским медијима, непроменивши се. Популаризован је шездесетих година двадесетог века заједно са листовима летерсета који су садржали Lorem Ipsum пасусе, а данас са софтверским пакетом за прелом као што је Aldus PageMaker који је садржао Lorem Ipsum верзије.\n\nΕλληνικά\n\nΤάχιστη αλώπηξ βαφής ψημένη γη, δρασκελίζει υπέρ νωθρού κυνός Τάχιστη αλώπηξ βαφής ψημένη γη, δρασκελίζει υπέρ νωθρού κυνός.

They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, \"Oh, why can\'t you remain like this for ever!\" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nMrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children\'s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.\n\nIf you could keep awake (but of course you can\'t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.\n\nI don\'t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person\'s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child\'s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.\n\nOf course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John\'s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other\'s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.\n\nOf all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.\n\nOccasionally in her travels through her children\'s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael\'s minds, while Wendy\'s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.','Post Format: Standard','','publish','closed','closed','','post-format-standard','','','2010-10-05 00:27:25','2010-10-05 07:27:25','',0,'https://wpthemetestdata.wordpress.com/?p=358',0,'post','',0),(501,2,'2010-08-01 09:42:26','2010-08-01 16:42:26','The last item in this page\'s content is a thumbnail floated left.

The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let\'s get started.\n\nOn the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options of <em>None</em>, <em>Left</em>, <em>Right, </em>and <em>Center</em>. In addition, they also get the options of <em>Thumbnail</em>, <em>Medium</em>, <em>Large</em> &amp; <em>Fullsize</em>. Be sure to try this page in RTL mode and it should look the same as LTR. \n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-906 aligncenter\" title=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" alt=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /></p>\nThe image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-904 alignleft\" title=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" alt=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150-1.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /> The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>. \n\nAs you can see there should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we\'ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it\'s thang. Mission accomplished!\n\nAnd now for a <em><strong>massively large image</strong></em>. It also has <em><strong>no alignment</strong></em>.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-907\" title=\"Image Alignment 1200x400\" alt=\"Image Alignment 1200x400\" src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002-1.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"400\" />\n\nThe image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area.

The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-905 alignright\" title=\"Image Alignment 300x200\" alt=\"Image Alignment 300x200\" src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200-1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />\n\nAnd now we\'re going to shift things to the <em><strong>right align</strong></em>. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there... Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don\'t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don\'t let anyone else tell you differently.\n\nIn just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah... Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.\n\nAnd just when you thought we were done, we\'re going to do them all over again with captions!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_906\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"580\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-906  \" title=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" alt=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /> Look at 580x300 getting some <a title=\"Image Settings\" href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/images/image-settings/\">caption</a> love.[/caption]\n\nThe image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_904\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-904  \" title=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" alt=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150-1.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /> Bigger caption than the image usually is.[/caption]\n\nThe rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>. \n\nAs you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image.

It should not have any alignment of any kind. It should just flow like you would normally expect. Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me.\n<h3>Left Align</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it\'s views. It\'s favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment.</p>\n\n<h3>Center Align</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes.</p>\n\n<h3>Right Align</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it\'s views. It\'s prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it\'s a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss.</p>\n\n<h3>Justify Align</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it\'s place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude.</p>','Markup: Text Alignment','','publish','closed','closed','','markup-text-alignment','','','2013-01-09 09:00:39','2013-01-09 16:00:39','',0,'http://wptest.io/demo/?p=895',0,'post','',0),(1177,2,'2013-01-10 20:15:40','2013-01-11 03:15:40','Welcome to image alignment! The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let\'s get started.\n\nOn the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options of <em>None</em>, <em>Left</em>, <em>Right, </em>and <em>Center</em>. In addition, they also get the options of <em>Thumbnail</em>, <em>Medium</em>, <em>Large</em> &amp; <em>Fullsize</em>. Be sure to try this page in RTL mode and it should look the same as LTR. \n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-906 aligncenter\" title=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" alt=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /></p>\nThe image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-904 alignleft\" title=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" alt=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150-1.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /> The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>. \n\nAs you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we\'ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it\'s thang. Mission accomplished!\n\nAnd now for a <em><strong>massively large image</strong></em>. It also has <em><strong>no alignment</strong></em>.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-907\" title=\"Image Alignment 1200x400\" alt=\"Image Alignment 1200x400\" src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002-1.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"400\" />\n\nThe image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-907\" title=\"Image Alignment 1200x400\" alt=\"Image Alignment 1200x400\" src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002-1.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"400\" />\n\nAnd we try the large image again, with the center alignment since that sometimes is a problem. The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-905 alignright\" title=\"Image Alignment 300x200\" alt=\"Image Alignment 300x200\" src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200-1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />\n\nAnd now we\'re going to shift things to the <em><strong>right align</strong></em>. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there... Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don\'t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don\'t let anyone else tell you differently.\n\nIn just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah... Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.\n\nAnd just when you thought we were done, we\'re going to do them all over again with captions!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_906\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"580\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-906  \" title=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" alt=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /> Look at 580x300 getting some <a title=\"Image Settings\" href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/images/image-settings/\">caption</a> love.[/caption]\n\nThe image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.

The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we\'ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it\'s thang. Mission accomplished!\n\nAnd now for a <em><strong>massively large image</strong></em>. It also has <em><strong>no alignment</strong></em>.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_907\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"]<img class=\" wp-image-907\" title=\"Image Alignment 1200x400\" alt=\"Image Alignment 1200x400\" src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002-1.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"400\" /> Comment for massive image for your eyeballs.[/caption]\n\nThe image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area.

The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_905\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-905 \" title=\"Image Alignment 300x200\" alt=\"Image Alignment 300x200\" src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200-1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /> Feels good to be right all the time.[/caption]\n\nAnd now we\'re going to shift things to the <em><strong>right align</strong></em>.

alignment! If you recognize this post, it is because these are blocks that have been converted from the classic <em>Markup: Image Alignment</em> post. The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let\'s get started. Be sure to try it in RTL mode. Left should stay left and right should stay right for both reading directions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options of <em>None</em>, <em>Left</em>, <em>Right, </em>and <em>Center</em>.

Be sure to test this page in RTL mode.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition, they also get the options of the image dimensions 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% or a set width and height.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":906,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" class=\"wp-image-906\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":904,\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img src=\"http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" class=\"wp-image-904\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image.
